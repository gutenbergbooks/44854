<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>Just as the history of a country is largely the history
of its great men, so the geography of a country is largely
the story of its great cities.</p>

<p>How much more easily history is grasped and remembered
when grouped around attractive biographies. With
great cities as the centers of geography-study, what is
generally considered a dry, matter-of-fact subject can be
made to attract, to inspire, and to fix the things which
should be remembered.</p>

<p>This book, &ldquo;Great Cities of the United States,&rdquo; includes
the ten largest cities of this country, together with
San Francisco, New Orleans, and Washington. <i>In it the
important facts of our country's geography have been grouped
around these thirteen cities.</i> The story of Chicago includes
the story of farming in the Middle West, of the great ore
industry on and around the Great Lakes, and of the varied
means of transportation. Cotton, sugar, and location are
shown to account largely for the greatness of New Orleans.
In a similar way, the stories of the other cities
sum up the important geography of our country.</p>

<p>Enough of the history of each city is given to show its
growth and development. The distinctive points of interest
are described so that one feels acquainted with the
things which attract the sight-seer. The commercial and
industrial features are made to stand out as the logical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
sequence of fortunate location for manufacturing, for
securing raw materials, for markets, and for convenient
means of transportation.</p>

<p>In order to make uniformly fair comparisons, local
statistics have been ignored and all data have been taken
from the latest government reports.</p>

<p>The authors wish to express their sincere appreciation
to the historical societies, to the chambers of commerce,
to those in the various cities who have furnished material
and reviewed the manuscript, and to all others who have
rendered assistance.</p>

<p>It is hoped that by the use of this book our country,
in all its greatness, will mean more and will appeal more
to the boys and girls of America than ever before.</p>

<p>To the publishers of Allen's &ldquo;Geographical and Industrial
Studies: United States&rdquo; we are indebted for the use
of the map appearing at the end of the text.</p>

<p class="caption">INDIANS VISITING THE <i>HALF MOON</i></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Drop anchor!&rdquo; rang out the command as the little
Dutch vessel furled her sails. On every side were the
shining waters of
a widespread bay,
while just ahead
stretched the forest-covered
shores of
an island.</p>

<p>All on board were
filled with excitement,
wondering
what lay beyond.
&ldquo;Have we at last
really found a waterway
across this new
land of America?&rdquo; they asked. There was only one way
to know&mdash;to go and see. So on once more, past the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
island, glided the <i>Half Moon</i>. From time to time, as she
sailed along, the redskin savages visited her and traded
many valuable furs for mere trifles.</p>

<p>But at last the <i>Half Moon</i> could go no further. This
was not a waterway to India, only a river leading into the
depths of a wild and rugged country. Sick with disappointment,
her captain, Henry Hudson, turned about, journeyed
the length of the river which was later to bear his name,
once more passed the island at the mouth of the river, and

<p>Manhattan was the Indian name for the island at the
mouth of the Hudson River. Tempted by Henry Hudson's
furs, the thrifty Dutchmen sent ship after ship to trade
with the American Indians. And as the years went by,
these Dutchmen built a trading post on Manhattan, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
a little Dutch village grew up about the post. Soon the
Dutch West India Company was formed to send out
colonists to Manhattan and the land along the Hudson.
A governor too was sent. His name was Peter Minuit.</p>

<p>Now Peter Minuit was honest, and when he found that
the Dutch were living on Indian land to which they had
helped themselves,
he was not content.
So he called
together the tribes
which lived on Manhattan
and, while
the painted warriors
squatted on the
ground, spoke to
them in words like
these: &ldquo;My brothers,
we have come
to trade with you.
And that we may
be near to buy your
furs when you have
gathered them, we
wish to live among
you, on your land.
It is your land, and as we do not mean to steal it from
you, I have asked you to meet me here that I may
buy from you this island which you call Manhattan.&rdquo;
Then, in payment for the island, Peter Minuit offered
the Indians ribbons, knives, rings, and colored beads&mdash;things
dearly loved by the savages. The bargain was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
soon closed, and for twenty-four dollars' worth of trinkets
the Dutch became the owners of Manhattan Island.</p>

</div>

<p>The Dutch settlement on Manhattan was called New
Amsterdam. New Amsterdam was a pretty town, with its
quaint Dutch houses built gable end toward the street and
its gardens bright with flowers. Dutch windmills with
their long sweeping arms rose here and there, and near
the water stood the fort.</p>

<p>But though New Amsterdam grew and prospered in
the years after Peter Minuit bought Manhattan, life there
did not run as smoothly as it might. In time Peter
Stuyvesant came to be governor, and a stern, tyrannical
ruler he was. He always saw things from the Dutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
West India Company's point of view, not from the colonists'.
Disagreement followed disagreement till the people
were nearly at the end of their patience.</p>

<p class="caption">WASHINGTON TAKING THE OATH OF OFFICE</p>
</div>

<p>Then, one day in 1664, an English fleet sailed into the
bay. A letter was brought ashore for Governor Stuyvesant.
England too, so it
seemed, laid claim
to this land along
the Hudson River,
and now asked the
Dutch governor to
give up his colony
to the Duke
of York, a brother
of England's king.
This done, the Dutch
colonists could keep
their property, and
all their rights and
privileges. In fact,
even greater privileges
would then
be given them.</p>

<p>In a towering
rage Governor Stuyvesant tore the letter into bits and
stamped upon them and called upon his colonists to rise
and help him repulse the English. But the colonists
would not rise. They felt that there was nothing to
gain by so doing. The English promised much, far more
than they had had under the rule of tyrannical Peter
Stuyvesant and the Dutch West India Company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>What could the governor do? Surely he alone could
not defeat the English fleet. So at last, sorrowfully and
reluctantly, he signed a surrender, and the Dutch Colony
was given over to the English.</p>

<p>Once in possession, the English renamed New Amsterdam,
calling it New York. Now followed a hundred years
of ever-increasing river, coast, and foreign trade, of growing
industries, of prosperity. And then&mdash;the Revolution.</p>

<p>When the Declaration
of Independence
was signed
on July 4, 1776,
George Washington
and his army were
in New York, guarding
the city from
the English. But before
the close of the
year he was forced
to retreat, and the
English took possession.
By the close
of the Revolution, in 1783, the English had robbed the
city of much of its wealth and had ruined its business.</p>

<p class="caption">THE FIRST TRAIN IN NEW YORK STATE</p>
</div>

<p>After the war the thirteen states who had won their
freedom from England joined together, drew up a constitution
for their common government, and chose their first
president. Then came the thirtieth of April, 1789. The
streets were crowded, and a great throng packed the
space before New York's Federal Hall. This was Inauguration
Day, and on the balcony stood General Washington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
taking the oath of office. It was a solemn moment. The
ceremony over, a mighty shout arose&mdash;&ldquo;Long live George
Washington, president of the United States.&rdquo; Cheers
filled the air, bells pealed, and cannons roared. The new
government had begun, and, for a time, New York was
the capital city.</p>

<p>Already New York was recovering from the effects of
the war. Her trade with European ports had begun again,
and it was no uncommon sight to see over one hundred
vessels loading or unloading in her harbor at one time.</p>

<p>New York harbor is one of the largest and best in the
world. Add to this the city's central location on the
Atlantic seaboard, and it is no wonder that a vast coasting
trade grew up with Eastern and Southern ports.</p>

<p>Without doubt, however, the greatest business event
in the history of New York City was the opening of the
Erie Canal in 1825. The canal joined the Great Lakes
with the Hudson River, making a water route from the
rich Northwest to the Atlantic, with New York as the
natural terminus. So with nearly all of the trade of
the lake region at her command, New York soon became
a great commercial center, outstripping both Boston and
Philadelphia, which up to this time had ranked ahead
of New York.</p>

<p>A few years later the building of railroads began.
The first railway from New York was begun in 1831,
and it was not long before the city was the terminus of
several lines and the chief railroad center of the Atlantic
coast. As the railroads did more and more of the carrying,
and the Erie Canal lost its former importance,
New York did not suffer from the change, but still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a><br /><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
controlled much of the trade between the Northwest and
European nations. Besides, as time went on, she built up
an immense traffic with all parts of the continent, being
easily reached by rail from the north, east, south, and west.</p>

<p class="caption">THE BOROUGHS OF NEW YORK&mdash;ENTRANCES TO HER HARBOR</p>
</div>

<p>The first half of the nineteenth century saw the arrival
of many thousand immigrants from Europe. These, with
the thousands of people who came from other parts of
America, attracted by the city's growing industries, made
more and more room necessary. First, about 13,000 acres
across the Harlem River were added to the city. Then,
in 1895, the city limits were extended to the borders
of Yonkers and Mt. Vernon. And finally, in 1898,
New York, Brooklyn, Long Island City, and some other
near-by towns were united under one government, forming
together Greater New York, the largest American city
and the second largest city in the world.</p>

<p>New York to-day covers about 360 square miles, its greatest
length from north to south being 32 miles, its greatest
width about 16. The city is divided into five boroughs:
Manhattan, The Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Richmond.
The Borough of Manhattan, on the long narrow
island of that name, lies between the Hudson and the
East River. North and east of Manhattan, on the mainland,
lies the Borough of The Bronx. Just across the
narrow East River, on Long Island, are the boroughs of
Queens and Brooklyn; while Staten Island is known
as the Borough of Richmond.</p>

<p>As more and more people came to the city the business
area on Manhattan proved too small, and with water
to the east, to the west, and to the south, there was
no possibility of spreading out in these directions. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
business kept increasing, and the cry for added room
became more and more urgent. Finally, the building
of the ten-story Tower Building in 1889 solved the
difficulty. It showed that, though hemmed in on all sides,
there was still one direction in which the business section
could grow&mdash;upwards. And upwards it has grown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
To-day lower Manhattan fairly bristles with huge steel-framed
skyscrapers which furnish miles and miles of
office space, twenty, thirty, forty, in one case even fifty-five,
stories above the street level. The supplying of office
and factory space is not the only use that has been made
of these steel buildings.
Great apartment
houses from
twelve to fifteen
stories high provide
homes for thousands.
Mammoth
hotels covering entire
city blocks
furnish temporary
homes for the multitudes
which visit
the city each year.
Fifteen of the largest
of these can
house more than
15,000 guests at one
time&mdash;a good-sized
city in itself. Thus
has Manhattan become
one of the most densely populated areas on the
globe. In the boroughs of Queens and Richmond, on the
other hand, large tracts of land are given over to farms
and market gardens.</p>

<p>Manhattan is at once the smallest and the most important
borough in the city. Here are the homes of more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
than 2,000,000 people, the business section of Greater
New York, and the chief shipping districts.</p>

<p>When building the narrow irregular streets of their
little town on lower Manhattan, the inhabitants of New
Amsterdam little dreamed that they would one day be
the scene of the
enormous traffic of
modern New York.
Those old, narrow,
winding streets to-day
swarm with hurrying
throngs from
morning till night
and are among the
busiest and noisiest
in the world.</p>

<p>The newer part
of the city from
Fourteenth Street
north to the Harlem
River has been laid
out in wide parallel
avenues running
north and south.
These are crossed
by numbered streets running east and west from river
to river. Fifth Avenue runs lengthwise through the
middle of the borough, dividing it into the East and
West sides. On the East Side you will find the crowded
homes of the poorer classes, where many of the working
people of Manhattan live. On the West Side are many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
manufacturing plants, lumber yards, and warehouses. On
the upper stretch of Fifth Avenue, and on the streets leading
off, are the homes of many of New York's wealthiest
residents. Opposite Central Park are some of the most
costly and beautiful mansions in the city.</p>

<p>In this regular arrangement of streets, Broadway alone
is the exception to the rule. Beginning at the southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
end of the island, it runs straight north for more than
two miles, then turns west and winds its way throughout
the whole length of the city. About its lower end, and
on some of the neighboring streets, center the banking
and financial interests. Here are many of the city's
richest banks and trust companies.</p>

<p>Wall Street, running east from Broadway about one
third of a mile from the southern end of Manhattan, was
named from the wall which the Dutch, in 1683, built
across the island at this point, because they heard that
the English were planning to attack them from the north.
Though only half a mile in length, Wall Street probably
surpasses all others in the extent of its business.</p>

<p>North of the banking center is the great wholesale region,
where merchants from all parts of the country buy
their stock in large quantities, to sell again to the retail
merchants. Beyond the wholesale region are the large
retail stores&mdash;New York's great shopping district. In
these retail stores
the merchants who
have bought from
the wholesalers sell
direct to the people
who are to use
the goods. In this
middle section of
the island are also
most of the better-class
hotels, restaurants,
clubs, and
theaters, which have
been gradually making
their way further
and further
uptown, crowding
the best resident
section still further
north.</p>

<p>The customhouse, where the government collects duties
on goods brought into the port of New York from other
lands, was built at the extreme southern end of the island,
where Fort Amsterdam used to stand. The United States
Sub-Treasury, in Wall Street, stands on the site of Federal
Hall, where Washington was inaugurated. Here are stored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
large quantities of gold, silver, and paper money belonging
to the government. In and about City Hall Park
are the post office, the courthouse, and the Hall of Records.
The new public library, on Fifth Avenue between
Fortieth and Forty-second
streets, is the
largest library building
in the world.</p>

<p>The city's parks are
many. Central Park,
in the center of Manhattan,
ranks among
the world's finest pleasure
grounds. It is two
miles and a half long
and one-half mile wide,
and has large stretches
of woodland, beautiful
lawns, gleaming lakes,
and sparkling fountains.
Here, too, are the
Metropolitan Museum
of Art and Cleopatra's
Needle&mdash;an obelisk
thousands of years old,
presented to the city
by a ruler of Egypt. And here are reservoirs which hold
the water brought by aqueducts from the Croton River,
about forty miles north of the city. This river was for
many years the sole source of Manhattan's water supply.
In 1905, however, the city began work on an immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a><br /><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a><br /><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
aqueduct which is to bring all the drinking-water for all five
boroughs from reservoirs in the Catskill Mountain region.</p>

of the most beautiful
boulevards in the city.</p>

<p>Then there are Prospect

the city.</p>

<p>Columbia University,
New York University,
Fordham, the College of the City of New York, and Barnard College are
among the most noted of New York's many educational
institutions.</p>

<p>About five million people live in this wonderful city,
and to supply them all with food is a tremendous business
in itself. During the night special trains bring milk,
butter, and eggs; refrigerator cars come laden with beef;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and from the market gardens of Long Island fruits and
vegetables are gathered and taken to the city during the
cool of the night that they may be sold, fresh and inviting,
in the morning.</p>

<p>Great numbers of New York's inhabitants are from
foreign lands. Several thousand Chinese manage to exist
in the few blocks which make up New York's Chinatown.
A large Italian population lives huddled together in Little
Italy, as well as in other sections of the city. Thousands
upon thousands of Jews are crowded into the Hebrew section
on the lower east side of Manhattan. There is also
a German and a French colony, as well as distinct Negro,
Greek, Russian, Armenian, and Arab quarters. Most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a><br /><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
these are in lower Manhattan, and in consequence lower

of shoppers, workers, and business men have gone home
for the night.</p>

<p>The necessity of carrying these shoppers, workers, and
business men to and from their homes in the residence
sections of the city and in the suburbs gradually led to
the development of New York's wonderful rapid-transit
system. Within the borders of Manhattan itself, horse cars
soon proved unequal to handling the crowds that each day
traveled north and south. So the first elevated railway
was built. Then six years later, a second line was constructed.
Others soon followed, not only in Manhattan
but also in Brooklyn and The Bronx. Raised high above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the busy streets by means of iron trestles, and making
but few stops, these elevated trains could carry passengers
much faster than the surface cars, and for a time the
problem seemed to be solved.</p>

<p>The traveling public was rapidly increasing, however,
and before the close of the nineteenth century both the
surface cars, now run by electricity, and the elevated
trains were sorely overcrowded during the morning and
evening rush hours. More cars were absolutely necessary,
and as there was little room to run them on or above
the surface, New York decided to make use of the space
under the ground, just as it had already turned to account
that overhead.</p>

<p>The work was begun in 1901. A small army of men
was set to blasting and digging tunnels underneath the
city streets,&mdash;a tremendous task,&mdash;and in 1904 the first
subway was opened. Electric cars running on these
underground tracks carry passengers from one end of the

<p>But what of the means of travel for those living outside

Island had to cross the East River on ferry boats. This
was particularly inconvenient in winter, when fogs or
floating ice were liable to cause serious delays. Besides,
as New York grew, such numbers crossed on the ferries
that they were overcrowded. Relief came for a time when,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
in 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was built over the East River
from Brooklyn to New York. This bridge is over a mile
long. Across it run a roadway, a walk for foot passengers,
and tracks for elevated trains as well as for surface cars.
Two even longer bridges, the Williamsburg Bridge and the
Manhattan Bridge, have since been built between Manhattan
and Brooklyn. Then, too, there is the Queensboro
Bridge, between Manhattan and the Borough of Queens.</p>

<p class="caption">NEW YORK'S SUBWAY AND BRIDGE CONNECTIONS</p>
</div>

<p>Though thousands and thousands daily crossed the
East River over these bridges, men soon foresaw that
the time was not far distant when ferries and bridges together
would be unable to take care of the ever-growing
traffic. Further means of travel had to be provided, and
the success of the city's underground railway suggested a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a><br /><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
practical idea. As early as 1908, the subway was continued
and carried under the East River to Brooklyn.
Several tubes have since been built under the Hudson,
connecting Manhattan with the New Jersey shore. To-day
New York is building many miles of new subway
under various parts of the city as well as under the Harlem
and East rivers. Carrying passengers under water has
proved as great a success as carrying them underground.</p>

<p>Over and above all these means of rapid transit, Greater
New York has at its service ten of America's great railroads.
The Pennsylvania Railroad has an immense station
in New York, one of the finest of its kind. Tunnels under
the Hudson and East rivers carry its trains to New Jersey
and Long Island.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>The new Grand Central Station is the greatest railroad
terminal in the world. The station is a beautiful building
of stone and marble, large enough to accommodate thirty
thousand people at one time. Between railroads and tunnels,
bridges and ferries, surface cars, elevated trains, and
subways, New York's rapid transit system is one of the
best in the world.</p>

<p>With such advantages as a receiving and distributing
center, it is small wonder that the city has become the
nation's chief market place. It is without a rival as the center
of the wholesale dry-goods and wholesale grocery businesses.
More than half of the imports of the United States
enter by way of New York's port, and its total foreign commerce
is five times that of any other city in the country.</p>

<p>Rubber, silk goods, furs, jewelry, coffee, tea, sugar, and
tin are among the leading imports. Cotton, meats, and
breadstuffs are the most important exports.</p>

<p>Besides being the principal market place of the United
States, New York is also its greatest workshop, as it
makes over one tenth of the manufactures of the country.
In the manufacture of clothing alone, more than a hundred
thousand people are employed. There are comparatively
few large factories for carrying on this work, as
much of it is done in tenement houses and in small workshops.
The growth of this industry has been largely due
to the abundance of cheap unskilled labor furnished by
the immigrant population of the city.</p>

<p>Second in importance is the refining of sugar and
molasses, carried on chiefly in Brooklyn along the East
River, where boats laden with raw sugar from the Southern
states and the West Indies unload their cargoes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
New York City leads in the refining of sugar as well as
in its importation.</p>

<p class="caption">THE BATTERY</p>
</div>

<p>Added to these, printing and publishing, the refining
of petroleum, slaughtering and meat packing, the roasting
and grinding of coffee and spices, the making of
foundry and machine-shop products, cigars, tobacco, millinery,
furniture, and jewelry are the leading industries
of the many thousands which have grown up in the city.
All this is largely due to the ease with which raw materials
can be obtained and finished articles marketed.
Thanks to its commercial advantages, New York leads
all American cities in the value of its manufactures and
surpasses them in the variety of its products.</p>

</div>

<p>At the southern end of Manhattan Island is the Battery.
In the old days the Battery was a fort. Now
it is used as an aquarium. From the Battery New
York's docks extend for miles along both sides of lower
Manhattan and line the Long Island and New Jersey
shores as well. The
wharves are piled
high with bales and
bags, boxes and
barrels. Ships from
the South come
with cargoes of cotton,
others bound
for England take
this cotton away.
Tank steamers from
Cuba bring molasses;
similar ones
are filled with petroleum
destined for
the ends of the
earth. Cattle boats
take on live stock
brought from the
West, grain ships
load at the many elevators built at the water's edge, and
vessels from all the larger ports of the world put ashore
goods of every description. Along both shores of the Hudson
River are the piers of the great trans-Atlantic steamship
companies, the landing places of the largest and fastest
passenger vessels in the world. Here also are the docks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of the many river and coastwise lines which carry passengers
to and from the cities and towns on the Hudson and
the Atlantic coast. Half the foreign trade and travel of the
United States passes over the wharves of lower Manhattan.</p>

<p>The entire harbor includes the Hudson and East rivers
and the upper and lower New York Bay with the connecting
strait known as The Narrows. The upper bay, New York's
real harbor, can be entered from the ocean in three ways&mdash;a
narrow winding channel around Staten Island, a northeast
entrance through Long Island Sound and the East River,
and an entrance through The Narrows from the lower bay.</p>

<p>What a different picture the harbor presents to-day from
the one Hudson saw over three hundred years ago! The
quiet undisturbed waters of that time are now alive the
year around with craft of every sort, from the giant ocean
liner to the graceful
sailboat. Vessels
freighted with
merchandise, tugs
towing canal boats,
ferries for Staten Island,
barges loaded
with coal, river
steamers, excursion
boats, and battleships
from far and
near, day and night,
pass in an endless
procession where
the solitary Indian
used to glide in his
silent canoe.</p>

<p>When the Dutch
bought Manhattan
it was a beautiful
wooded island inhabited
by Indians
who supplied their
simple wants by hunting and fishing. What a change
the island has undergone since that time! The Indians
have disappeared with the forest. In their place live and
struggle vast armies of human beings gathered together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
from all the corners of the earth. Where squaws used to
pitch their wigwams, giant skyscrapers tower up toward
the clouds. The stillness of the forest has been succeeded
by the noise and bustle of a busy city. The lazy monotonous
life of the savage has given way to a ceaseless
activity and hurry.</p>

<p>The twenty-four dollars which bought the whole island&mdash;less
than three hundred years ago&mdash;would not now buy
a single square inch in the center of the city. The hunting
and fishing ground of the red men has become the
heart of the greatest city of the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<h2><a name="CHICAGO" id="CHICAGO">CHICAGO</a></h2>

<p>&ldquo;Chicago is wiped out.&rdquo; &ldquo;Chicago cannot rise again.&rdquo;
So said the newspapers all over the country, in October,
1871. And well they might think so, for the great fire
of Chicago&mdash;one of the worst in the world's history&mdash;had
laid low the city.</p>

<p>The summer had been unusually dry. For months
almost no rain had fallen. The ground was hot and
parched, the whole city dry as kindling wood. Then
about nine o'clock on a windy Sunday night, the fire
broke out in a poor section of the West Side. It seemed
as if everything a spark touched, blazed up. While the
firemen stood by, helpless to check the flames, rows of
houses and blocks of factories burned down.</p>

<p>In a short time the lumber district was a great bonfire,
the flames shooting hundreds of feet into the air. On and
on swept the fire along the river front. Then the horror-stricken
watchers saw the flames cross to the South Side.
All had thought that the fire would be checked at the
river, but the wind carried pieces of burning wood and
paper to the roofs beyond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>The business section was burning! The firemen worked
desperately, but in vain. Hundreds of Chicago's finest
buildings&mdash;stores, offices, banks, and hotels&mdash;were swallowed
up by the flames. The city had become a roaring
furnace, and the terrified people rushed madly for safety.</p>

<p>Once more the fire crossed the river, this time to the
North Side, with its beautiful residence districts. Here
too wind and flame swept all before them till Lincoln
Park was reached, where at last the fire was checked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
in its northward course; there was nothing more to
burn. It had raged for two nights and a day, laying
waste a strip of land almost four miles long and one
mile wide.</p>

HOME OF JOHN KINZIE</p>
</div>

<p>Tuesday morning saw seventeen thousand buildings destroyed
and one hundred thousand people homeless. The
best part of Chicago lay in ruins. What wonder that men
everywhere thought the stricken city could not rise again!</p>

<p>At the time this terrible disaster happened, Chicago had
been a city for a little less than thirty-five years.</p>

<p>The mouth of the Chicago River had been a favorite
meeting place for Indians and French trappers long before
permanent settlement began. In 1777 a negro from San
Domingo, who had come to trade with the Indians, built
a log store on the north bank of the river. This store
was bought in 1803 by John Kinzie, another trader and
Chicago's first white settler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The next year the United States government built
Fort Dearborn on the south side of the river, not far
from the lake. Though Fort Dearborn was nothing more
than a stockade with blockhouses at the corners, a little
settlement gradually grew up around it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

        <a name="img_44" id="img_44"></a>
<p class="caption">WHERE CHICAGO WAS FOUNDED</p>
</div>

<p>During the War of 1812 the Indians attacked the fort,
burned it to the ground, and either massacred or captured
most of the settlers while they were fleeing to Detroit for
safety.</p>

<p>Fort Dearborn was rebuilt after the war, but settlers
were slow in coming. By 1830 there were scarcely a
hundred people in Chicago, then a little village of log<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
houses scattered over a swampy plain. Fur trading was
still the chief occupation.</p>

<p>A change was soon to come. The southern part of
Illinois was by this time being settled and dotted with
farms, and each year larger crops were produced. The
farmers saw that they must get their products to the
Atlantic coast if they wished to prosper, and the Great
Lakes were the most convenient route over which to
send them.</p>

<p>Lake Michigan extended into the heart of the fertile
prairie lands, but its shores were almost unbroken by
harbors. Men early saw the possibilities of the mouth
of the Chicago River. It could be made into an excellent
harbor with little expense, and if once this were
done, Chicago would be the natural port of the rich
Middle West.</p>

<p>In 1833 the government began improvements by cutting
a channel through the sand bar across the mouth of
the river and building stone piers into the lake to keep
out the drifting sand. Vessels were soon entering the
river instead of anchoring in the lake as formerly. Lake
trade increased. More and more boats were bringing
goods from the East to be distributed among the farmers
of Illinois. The new harbor made intercourse with the
outer world easy.</p>

<p>The growth of trade, however, was hindered by the
absence of good roads. Farmers who wished to bring
anything to the Chicago market had to cross the open
prairie, which was wet and marshy near the town. Such
a ride was an unpleasant experience, as often the wagon
would stick in the deep mud, and the poor driver had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
choice but to wait until help should happen along. Many
preferred to take their crops to the cities farther south,
where better roads had been built.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">AN EARLY CHICAGO DRAWBRIDGE</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;We too will have roads,&rdquo; said the people of Chicago,
anxious for more trade, and they set about building them
with a will. Soon good roads entered the town from
all directions, and over them the rich products of the
surrounding country came pouring into Chicago.</p>

<p>Business and wealth increased, and more and more
settlers arrived. Most of them came by way of the lakes,
but many came in prairie schooners, as the immigrants'
great covered wagons were called. By 1837 the population
had risen to four thousand, and Chicago became a city.</p>

<p>Its growth from this time was marvelous. Its location
at the head of Lake Michigan, its fine harbor, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
resources of the rich back country, all combined to make
it the chief commercial center of the Middle West.</p>

<p class="caption">WHERE THE STAGECOACH STARTED</p>
</div>

<p>In the early days, when Chicago was only a tiny
village, there had been talk of connecting Lake Michigan
at Chicago with the Illinois River by canal. As the
Illinois flows into the Mississippi, this would furnish a
water route from the East down the entire Mississippi
valley. In 1836 the canal was actually begun. A few
years later hard times came, and the work was stopped
for a while, but it was finished in 1848. This was known
as the Illinois and Michigan Canal. It extended from
La Salle, on the Illinois River, to Chicago&mdash;a distance
of over ninety miles&mdash;and offered cheap transportation
between Chicago and the fertile farm lands to the south.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

        <a name="img_48" id="img_48"></a>
<p class="caption">CHICAGO'S CANALS</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the canal was a success, railroads did even
more for the city. The year that saw the canal completed
also saw the first train run from Chicago to Galena, near
the Mississippi, in the heart of the lead country.</p>

<p>Four years later, in 1852, came railroad connection
with the East, when the Michigan Southern and Michigan
Central railroads entered the city. Other lines soon
followed, and it was not long before Chicago was one
of the important railroad centers of the country.</p>

<p>But while Chicago was fast becoming rich and big, it
was not a pleasant place in which to live. The site of the
city was a low and marshy plain, almost on a level with
the lake, and the problems of drainage of such a location
had to be met and solved.</p>

<p>In the beginning, to keep the houses dry, they were
built above the ground and supported by timbers or piles.
Cellars and basements were unknown, and the city streets
were a disgrace. In spring they were flooded and swimming
with mud. Even in summer, pools of stagnant
water stood in many places. For years wagons sticking
fast in the mud were common sights.</p>

<p>Cholera, smallpox, and scarlet fever swept the city
again and again. People, knowing only too well that
unsanitary conditions brought on these diseases, did their
best to remedy matters. They saw that Chicago would
be clean and healthy if only they could find a way to
carry off her wastes.</p>

<p>First they decided to turn the water into the river by
sloping all the streets towards it. Then came a severe flood
which did much damage and showed the folly of digging
down any part of the city. Chicago was too low already.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>So the people hastened to raise their streets again by
filling them in with sand, and this time they made
gutters along the side to carry off the water. Heavy
wagons soon wore away the sand, however, and the
streets were as muddy as before.</p>

<p>Finally, an engineer advised the people to raise the
whole city several feet; then brick sewers could be built
beneath the street to carry the sewage into the river. At
first many refused to listen to such a proposal. The
undertaking was so great that it frightened them.</p>

<p>But as things were, business and health were suffering.
Something had to be done, and at last the city determined
to raise itself out of the mud, and work was begun.
Ground was hauled in from the surrounding country,
streets and lots were filled in, the buildings were gradually
raised, and sewers were built sloping toward the
river. It was a gigantic task and cost years of labor, but
when it was done, Chicago was, for the first time, a dry
city. It must be remembered that the area of Chicago
at that time was but a small part of the present city.</p>

<p>Another source of trouble was the drinking-water,
which was taken from Lake Michigan. The sewage in
the river flowed into the lake and at times contaminated
the water far out from the shore, thus poisoning the city's
supply. It was therefore decided to build new waterworks,
which would bring into the city pure water from farther
out in the lake. A tunnel was built, extending two miles
under Lake Michigan. At its outer end a great screened
pipe reached up into the lake to let water into the tunnel.
Over the pipe a crib was built to protect it. On the
shore, pumping stations with powerful engines raised the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
water to high towers from which all parts of the city
were supplied.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/img_051.jpg" width="600" height="462"
        alt="see caption"
        title="see caption" />
<p class="caption">CHICAGO HIGH SCHOOL, 1856</p>
</div>

<p>The first tunnel was completed in 1867. With the
growth of the city other tunnels and cribs have been
built, farther out in the lake, to supply the increasing need.</p>

<p>By 1870 Chicago had become one of the largest cities
in the country. In 1830 the settlement at the mouth of
the Chicago River had barely twenty houses. Forty years
later it had over three hundred thousand inhabitants.
The wonderful resources of the upper Mississippi valley
had been largely responsible for the city's growth, and the
rapid development of the entire West promised Chicago a
still greater future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came the fire, and to the homeless people looking
across miles of blackened ruins it seemed that Chicago
had no future at all. Had not the fire undone the work
of forty years?</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>The first despair gradually gave way to a more hopeful
feeling. Truly the loss was great&mdash;the best part
of the city lay in ruins. But was not the wealth of
the West left, and the harbor and the railroads? These
had built up Chicago in the beginning, and they would
do so again.</p>

<p>The rebuilding began at once. At first little wooden
houses and sheds were constructed to give temporary
shelter to the homeless. Help came to the stricken city
from all sides. Thousands of carloads of food were sent,
and several million dollars were collected in Europe and
America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Two thirds of the city had been built of wood. Now
the business blocks, at least, were to be as nearly fireproof
as possible. Tall buildings of brick and stone were
planned. But such structures are heavy, and if they
were built directly on the swampy ground underlying
the city, there would be danger of their settling unevenly
and possibly toppling over. So layers of steel
rails crossing each other were sunk in the ground, and
the spaces between them were filled in with concrete.
Upon this solid foundation the first skyscrapers of
Chicago were built.</p>

<p>To-day concrete caissons are constructed on bed rock, often
from 100 to 110 feet below the surface, and upon these
rest the steel bases of the modern Chicago skyscrapers.</p>

<p>Work went on quickly. In a year the business section
was rebuilt. In three years there was hardly a trace of
the fire to be seen in the city, which was larger and more
beautiful than before.</p>

<p>After the rebuilding, the water question came up for
discussion again. In spite of all that had been done to
protect the water supply, the increasing sewage of the
city, carried by the river into the lake, at times still made
the water unfit to drink. The one way of getting pure
water was to prevent the river from flowing into the lake.
This could be done only by building a new canal, large
and deep enough to change the flow of the river away
from the lake. Such a canal was finally completed in
1900, after eight years' work and at a cost of over
$75,000,000. It is 28 miles long, 22 feet deep, and 165
feet wide, and it connects the Chicago River with the Des
Plaines, a branch of the Illinois River. A large volume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of water from Lake Michigan continually flushes this immense
drain, carrying the sewage away. The Chicago
River no longer flows into the lake, and at last the danger
of contaminated drinking-water from this source is past.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/img_054.jpg" width="600" height="351"
        alt="see caption"
        title="see caption" />
<p class="caption">BUSY SCENE AT ENTRANCE TO CHICAGO RIVER</p>
</div>

<p>One dream of the builders of the canal has not yet
been realized. They called it the Chicago Drainage and
Ship Canal, in the hope that it might some day be used
for shipping purposes as well as for draining the river.
This cannot happen, however, till the rivers which it
connects are deepened and otherwise improved.</p>

<p>Such has been the history of the growth of Chicago&mdash;to-day
the greatest railroad center and lake port in the
world. It is now the second city in size in America and
ranks fourth among the cities of the world.</p>

<p>The port of Chicago owes much to the Chicago River,
which has been repeatedly widened, deepened, and straightened.
It is to-day one of the world's most important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
rivers, commercially considered. After extending about
one mile westward from the lake, the river divides into
two branches, one extending northwest, the other southwest.
Many docks have been built along its fifteen miles
of navigable channel, and its banks are lined with factories,
warehouses, coal yards, and grain elevators.</p>

CHICAGO'S FIRST GRAIN ELEVATOR</p>
</div>

<p>These grain elevators are really huge tanks where the
grain is stored and kept dry until time to reship it. There
are many of them along the river, and they bear witness
to the fact that Chicago is the world's greatest
grain center.</p>

<p>In 1838 the city received only seventy-eight bushels of
wheat. This was brought in by wagons rumbling across
the unbroken prairie. Canal boats and railroads have
taken the place of the wagons of early days and every
year bring hundreds of millions of bushels of grain from
the West to the elevators along the Chicago River.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Though much of the grain remains here but a short
time and is then shipped to other points, a great quantity
is made into flour in the city's many flourishing mills.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">A GRAIN ELEVATOR OF TO-DAY</p>
</div>

<p>Of equal importance with the Chicago River harbor is
the great harbor in South Chicago at the mouth of the
Calumet River. Here ships from the Lake Superior region
come with immense cargoes of ore. This ore, together with
the supply of coal from the near-by Illinois coal fields, has
developed the enormous steel industry of South Chicago.</p>

<p>Vast quantities of steel are turned out. Some of this is
shipped to foreign countries, but most of it is used in
Chicago's many foundries for the making of all kinds of
iron and steel articles, in the city's immense farm-tool factories,
and in the shipyards for building large steamships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Close to the water front, too, are extensive lumber yards,
for Chicago is the largest lumber market in the United
States. Here boats can be seen unloading millions of feet
of timber from the great forests of Michigan and Wisconsin,
sent to Chicago's lumber yards to be distributed
far and wide over the country. Large quantities are
also taken to the factories in the city, to be cut and
planed and made into doors, window frames, furniture,
and practically everything that can be made of wood.</p>

<p>In addition to her inner harbors, Chicago has a fine
outer harbor. This is now being enlarged by the extension
of its breakwaters, and a $5,000,000 pier is under
construction which will be more than half a mile in
length and will greatly increase the shipping facilities.</p>

<p>With all these advantages as a shipping point, thousands
of vessels come to Chicago every year. Steamers
connect it with the states along the Great Lakes and with
Canada and the outer world. Its trade with Europe is
large, corn and oats being the chief exports. New York
alone in America surpasses Chicago in the total value
of its commerce.</p>

<p class="caption">COURTHOUSE AND CITY HALL</p>
</div>

<p>Of Chicago's nearly 2,500,000 inhabitants a large percentage
are foreign born, Germans, Poles, Irish, and Jews
having settled here in great numbers. About forty languages
are spoken, and newspapers are regularly published
in ten of them.</p>

<p>With its suburbs, Chicago stretches nearly 30 miles
along the shore of Lake Michigan and reaches irregularly
inland about 10 miles. The city limits inclose an area
of over 191 square miles, which the two branches of the
Chicago River cut into three parts, known as the South,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
West, and North sides. The three divisions of the city
are connected by bridges and by tunnels under the river.</p>

<p>Though business is spreading to the West Side, the
central business section is still on the South Side and
extends from the Chicago River beyond Twenty-sixth
Street. Most of the
great wholesale and
retail houses, banks,
theaters, hotels, and
public buildings are
crowded into this
area, and here is the
largest department
store in the world,
in which over 9000
people work. The
automobile industry
alone occupies
nearly all of Michigan
Avenue for
two miles south of
Twelfth Street.</p>

<p>Surrounding this
crowded business section
are most of the terminals of Chicago's many railroads.
These connect the city with New York, Boston, and Philadelphia
in the East; with New Orleans, Galveston, and
Atlanta in the South; as well as with San Francisco and
the other large cities of the West. The courthouse and
city hall and the new Northwestern Railway Station are
among the city's finest buildings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Elevated railways and a freight subway have been built
in recent years and have somewhat relieved the crowded
condition of the streets. This subway, opened in 1905,
connects with all the leading business and freight houses,
and carries coal, ashes, garbage, luggage, and heavy
materials of every kind to and from them.</p>

<p>Five miles southwest of the city hall are the Union
Stockyards, the greatest market of any kind in the world,
covering about five hundred acres. When Chicago was
only a small village, herds of cattle were driven across the
prairies to be slaughtered in the little packing houses
which grew up along the Chicago River. As the raising
of cattle and hogs increased in the state, most of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a><br /><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
were sent to the Chicago market, and the stockyards continued
to develop until to-day they can hold more than
four hundred thousand animals at once.</p>

<p>Near the yards are the famous packing houses of Chicago,
where over two thirds of the cattle, hogs, and sheep
received in the city are slaughtered and prepared for shipping.
The use, during the last forty years, of refrigerator
cars has made possible the sending of dressed meats to far-distant
points, and a great increase in Chicago's packing
business has resulted.</p>

<p>Beef, pork, hams, and bacon from Chicago are eaten in

<p>There is no one striking residence quarter in Chicago,
but beautiful homes are found in many parts of the city.
Among the finest streets are Lake Shore Drive, along the
lake front on the North Side, and Drexel and Grand
avenues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The parks of Chicago are nearly one hundred in number,
the most important being Lincoln, Washington, Humboldt,
Garfield, Douglas, and Jackson. These are connected by
boulevards, or parkways, forming a great park system,
sixty miles in length, which encircles the central part of
the city. Lincoln
Park borders the
lake on the North
Side and covers hundreds
of acres, its
area having been
doubled by filling
in along the shores
of the lake. Jackson
Park, on the lake
shore of the South
Side, was the site
of the World's Columbian
Exposition,
which celebrated the
four-hundredth anniversary
of the discovery
of America.
This park is connected
with Washington Park by what is known as the
Midway. Grant Park has been recently constructed on
made land facing the central business portion of the
city. Here is to be located the Field Museum of Natural
History.</p>

<p>Bordering the Midway are the fine stone buildings of
The University of Chicago, opened in 1892. Its growth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
like that of Chicago, has been marvelous. Already it is
one of the largest universities of the country.</p>

<p>But with all its parks, its boulevards, its splendid
water front, and its many other advantages, the people
of Chicago are not yet satisfied. To-day they are working
to carry out a splendid plan which will give the city more
and larger parks and playgrounds, better and wider
streets, and a really wonderful harbor. All this is being
done &ldquo;that by properly solving Chicago's problems of

health, the city may grow indefinitely in wealth and commerce
and hold her position among the great cities of

<h2><a name="PHILADELPHIA" id="PHILADELPHIA">PHILADELPHIA</a></h2>

<p>In early days, when there was no United States and
our big America was a vast wilderness inhabited mostly
by Indians, people who came here were thought very
adventuresome and brave.</p>

<p>At that time there lived in England a distinguished
admiral who was a great friend of the royal family. The
king owed him about $64,000, and at his death this claim
was inherited by his son, William Penn. Now William
Penn was an ardent Quaker, and because of the persecution
of the Quakers in England he decided to found a
Quaker colony in another country. King Charles II, who
seldom had money to pay his debts, was only too glad to
settle Penn's claim by a grant of land in America. To
this grant, consisting of 40,000 square miles lying west
of the Delaware River, the king gave the name Pennsylvania,
meaning &ldquo;Penn's Woods.&rdquo; The next year, 1682,
William Penn and his Quaker followers entered the
Delaware River in the ship <i>Welcome</i>.</p>

<p>Penn believed in honesty and fair play. He was generous
enough not to limit his colony to one religion or
nationality. All who were honest and industrious were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
welcome. The laws he made were extremely just, and
land was sold to immigrants on very easy terms.</p>

<p class="caption">PENN'S TREATY WITH THE INDIANS</p>
</div>

<p>Soon after his arrival in America, Penn wisely made
a treaty with the Indians whose wigwams and hunting
grounds were on or near the banks of the Delaware River.
Beneath the graceful branches of a great elm he and the
Indian chief exchanged wampum belts, signifying peace
and friendship. In the center of the belt which Penn
received are two figures, one representing an Indian, the
other a European, with hands joined in friendship. This
belt is still preserved in Philadelphia by the Historical
Society of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class="caption">LOCATION OF PHILADELPHIA</p>
</div>

<p>In 1683 Penn laid out in large squares, between the
Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, the beginning of a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
city. This city he called Philadelphia, a word which
means &ldquo;brotherly love.&rdquo; At that time the so-called city
had an area of 2 square miles and a population of
only 400. To-day Philadelphia has an area of nearly
130 square miles and a population of more than a million
and a half. It is America's third city in population, and
it ranks third among the manufacturing cities of the
United States.
Philadelphia is
on the Delaware
River, a
hundred miles
from the ocean,
but it has all
the advantages
of a seaport,
for the river is
deep enough
to let great
ocean steamers
navigate to the city's docks. Philadelphia's easy access
to the vast stores of iron, coal, and petroleum, for which
Pennsylvania is famous, its location on two tidewater
rivers,&mdash;the Delaware and the Schuylkill,&mdash;and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
important railroads, all have helped to make it a great
industrial and commercial center. One half of the anthracite
coal in the United States is mined in Pennsylvania.
Much of it is shipped to Philadelphia and from there
by rail and water to many other states and countries.</p>

<p class="caption">THE OLD STAGE WHICH JOURNEYED FROM PHILADELPHIA TO PITTSBURGH</p>
</div>

<p>Some of the greatest manufacturing plants in the
United States, in fact in the world, are in Philadelphia.
In certain branches of the textile, or woven-goods, industry
Philadelphia is unsurpassed. In the making of
woolen carpets she leads the world. This industry goes
back to Revolutionary times, when the first yard of carpet
woven in the United States came from a Philadelphia
loom. In 1791 a local manufacturer made a carpet,
adorned with patriotic emblems, for the United States
Senate.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Other important industries of the city include the manufacturing
of woolen and worsted goods, hosiery and knit
goods, rugs, cotton goods, felt hats, silk goods, cordage,
and twine and the dyeing and finishing of textiles. The
largest lace mill in the world is in Philadelphia.</p>

<p class="caption">OLD IRONSIDES</p>
</div>

<p>Philadelphia is also noted for the manufacture of iron
and steel. The largest single manufactory in Philadelphia
is the Baldwin Locomotive Works, which is the greatest
of its kind. Pictures
of the old
Flying Machine, a
stagecoach which
made trips to New
York in 1776, and
of Old Ironsides,
the first locomotive
built by Matthias
W. Baldwin in 1832,
seem very queer
in comparison with
the powerful 300-ton locomotives built in Philadelphia
to-day. Old Ironsides weighed a little over 4 tons and
lacked power to pull a loaded train on wet and slippery
rails; hence the following notice which appeared in the
newspapers: &ldquo;The locomotive engine built by Mr. M. W.
Baldwin of this city will depart daily when the weather
is fair with a train of passenger cars. On rainy days
horses will be attached.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Besides the American railroads using Baldwin locomotives,
engines built in this plant are in use in many

<p>Philadelphia holds an important place in the construction
of high-grade machine tools. She has great rolling
mills, foundries, and machine shops, and one of the most
famous bridge-building establishments in the world. Her
people smile at being called slow; in fourteen weeks a
Philadelphia concern made from pig iron a steel bridge a
quarter of a mile long, carried it halfway around the world,
and set it up over a river in Africa.</p>

<p>Shipbuilding in Philadelphia began with the founding
of the colony. It was the first American city to build
ships and was also the home of the steamboat. The first
boat to be propelled by steam was built by John Fitch in
Philadelphia in 1786. This was more than twenty years
before Robert Fulton had his first steamboat on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Hudson River. Robert Fulton, who was a Pennsylvanian
by birth, also lived at one time in Philadelphia.
Shipbuilding, to-day, is one of the city's great industries.</p>

<p>The art of printing has been practiced in Philadelphia
since the very beginning of its history. William Bradford,
one of the first colonists, published an almanac for the
year 1687. This was the first work printed in Philadelphia.
Benjamin Franklin entered the printing business
in Philadelphia in 1723, and six years later published the
<i>Pennsylvania Gazette</i>. This was the second newspaper
printed in the colony, the first being the <i>American
Weekly Mercury</i>, the first edition of which was printed
in Philadelphia in 1719. Both of these papers were very
small and would appear very odd alongside of the daily
papers of to-day. The first complete edition of the Bible
printed in the United States was published by Christopher
Saur in Germantown, which is now a part of
Philadelphia, in 1743. Philadelphia ranks first among
the cities of the United States in the publication of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
scientific books and law books. One of the large publishing
houses of the city now uses over a million dollars'
worth of paper each year. It is interesting to know that
when the Revolutionary War began there were forty
paper mills in and near Philadelphia. At that time, and for
many years after, it
was the great literary
center of the
country.</p>

</div>

<p>When William
Penn founded his
Quaker town in
the wilderness, he
made little provision
for parks, as
at that time the
town was so small
and was so surrounded
by forests
that no parks were
needed. But Philadelphia
now possesses
the largest
park in the United
States. This is known as Fairmount Park, which covers
over three thousand acres of land. Splendid paths and
driveways give access to every section of this park. On
all sides one sees beautiful landscape gardening, fine old
trees, and picturesque streams and bridges. Here is a
great open amphitheater where concerts are given during
the summer months; here are athletic fields, playgrounds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
race courses, and splendid stretches of water for rowing;
and here also for many years were located the immense
waterworks which pumped the city's water supply from
the Schuylkill River.</p>

<p class="caption">LOOKING NORTH ON BROAD STREET</p>
</div>

<p>Among the famous buildings in the park are Memorial
Hall and Horticultural Hall. They were erected at the
time of the great Centennial Exhibition, which was held
in Philadelphia in
1876 to celebrate the
hundredth birthday
of American independence.
Memorial
Hall is now used as
an art gallery and city
museum. Horticultural
Hall contains
a magnificent collection
of plants and
botanical specimens,
brought from many
different countries.</p>

<p>Another interesting building in Fairmount Park is the
little brick house which was once the home of William
Penn. It is said to have been the first brick house erected
in Philadelphia. It stood on a lot south of Market Street,
and between Front and Second streets. Some years ago it
was moved from its original site to Fairmount Park, where
thousands of people now visit it. Here too, before the
Revolutionary War, was the home of Robert Morris, the
great American financier, who, during that war, time and
again raised money to pay the soldiers of the American army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Many statues of American heroes ornament the driveways
and walks of Fairmount Park. At the Green Street
entrance stands one of the finest equestrian statues
of Washington in
the country. The
carved base, which
is made of granite
and decorated with
bronze figures, is
approached by thirteen
steps, to represent
the original
thirteen states.</p>

<p>The streets of
Philadelphia, while
not broad, are well
paved, and many of
them are bordered
by fine old trees. It
was William Penn
who named many
of the streets after
trees. The names
of several of the streets in the oldest part of the town
are recalled in the old refrain:</p>

<p class="caption">THE CITY-HALL STATUE OF PENN</p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the city hall is the most striking of the notable
buildings. It is a massive structure of marble and
granite and stands at the intersection of Broad and
Market streets. This immense building covers four and a
half acres and is built in the form of a hollow square
around an open court. The most attractive feature of the
building is the great tower surmounted by an immense
statue of William Penn. This lofty tower is nearly
548 feet high and is 90 feet square at its base. It is
67 feet higher than the great Pyramid of Egypt and
nearly twice as high as the dome of the Capitol at
Washington. The Washington Monument exceeds it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
height by but a few feet. The great statue of Penn is
as tall as an ordinary three-story house and weighs over
26 tons. It is cast of bronze and was made of 47 pieces
so skillfully put together that the closest inspection can
scarcely discover the seams. Around the head is a circle
of electric lights throwing their brilliant illumination
a distance of 30
miles. To one gazing
upwards, the
light seems a halo
of glory about the
head of the beloved
founder of the city.</p>

<p>Philadelphia has
many fine schools,
both public and private.
The two most
noted educational
institutions are the
University of Pennsylvania
and Girard
College. The University
of Pennsylvania
was founded
largely through the efforts of Benjamin Franklin. It now
occupies more than fifty buildings west of the Schuylkill
River and is widely known as a center of learning.</p>

<p>Girard College was the gift of Stephen Girard, who,
from a humble cabin boy, became one of Philadelphia's
richest benefactors. The college is a charitable institution
devoted to the education of orphan boys, who are admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a><br /><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to it between the ages of six and ten. Girard left almost
his entire fortune of over $7,000,000 for the establishment
of this great educational home for poor boys. Two millions
of this sum were for the erection of the buildings alone.</p>

<p>When the United States became an independent nation
it was necessary to have a coinage system of its own. In
1792 a mint was established in Philadelphia to coin
money for the United States government. All of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
money is not now made in Philadelphia. The paper currency
is made in Washington, and there are mints for
the coinage of gold, silver, and copper in San Francisco,
Denver, and New Orleans as well as in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>A visit to the
Philadelphia mint
is most interesting.
Visitors are conducted
through the
many rooms of this
great money factory
and are shown the
successive processes
through which the
gold, silver, nickel,
and copper must pass
before it becomes
money.</p>

<div class="figright">

<p class="caption">INDEPENDENCE HALL</p>
</div>

<p>We first see the
metal in the form
of bars or bricks.
In another room we
find men at work
melting the gold
and mixing with it copper and other metals to strengthen
it. Coins of pure gold would wear away very rapidly, and
so these other metals are added. The prepared metal is
cast into long strips, about the width and thickness of the
desired coins. In still another room these strips are fed into
a machine which punches out round pieces of the size and
weight required. These disks are then carefully weighed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and inspected, after which they are taken to the coining
room to receive the impression of figures and letters which
indicates their value. One by one the blank disks are
dropped between two steel dies. The upper die bears the
picture and lettering which is to appear upon the face of the
coin, and the lower,
that which is to appear
on the reverse
side. As the disk
lies between them
the two dies come together,
exerting an
enormous pressure
upon the cold metal.
The pressure is then
removed, and the
bright disk drops
from the machine,
stamped with the impression
which has
changed this piece of
metal into a coin of
the United States. All coins are made in much the same way.</p>

<p>In our brief visit we see many wonderful machines for
counting, weighing, and sorting the thousands of coins
which are daily produced in this busy place. At every
step we are impressed with the great precautions taken to
safeguard the precious materials handled.</p>

<p>The old parts of Philadelphia are even more interesting
than the mint, because of their historic associations.
Within the distance of a few squares one may visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
famous buildings whose very names send thrills of pride
through the heart of every good American.</p>

<p>Old Christ Church, whose communion service was
given by England's Queen Anne in 1708, is perhaps the
most noted of Philadelphia's historic churches. In this
old church Benjamin Franklin worshiped for many years,
and when he died he was buried in its quaint churchyard.
And here too
George Washington
and John Adams
worshiped when Philadelphia
was the
capital city.</p>

<p>Carpenters' Hall
and Independence
Hall ought to be
known and remembered
by every boy
and girl in America.
When the Massachusetts
colonists
held the Boston Tea
Party, England undertook to punish Massachusetts by
closing her chief port. This meant ruin to Boston. All the
English colonists in America were so aroused that they
determined to call a meeting of representatives from each
colony, to consider the wisest course of action and how to
help Massachusetts. It was in Carpenters' Hall that this
first Continental Congress met, in September, 1774. The
building was erected in 1770 as a meeting place for the
house carpenters of Philadelphia&mdash;hence its name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>On Chestnut Street stands the old statehouse, which
is called Independence Hall because it was the birthplace
of our liberty. Here it was that, when all hope of peace
between the colonies
and England had
been given up, the
colonial representatives
met in 1776 in
the Continental Congress
and adopted the
Declaration of Independence,
which
declared that England's
American colonies
should henceforth
be free and
independent. While
the members of Congress
discussed the
Declaration and its
adoption, throngs
packed the streets
outside, impatiently
waiting to know the
result. At last the
great bell rang out&mdash;the
signal of the joyous news that the Declaration of
Independence had been adopted.</p>

<p>Independence Hall was built to be used as a statehouse
for the colony of Pennsylvania. The old building
has been kept as nearly as possible in its original condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and is now considered &ldquo;A National Monument to the
Birth of the Republic.&rdquo; This sacred spot is under the
supervision of the Sons of the American Revolution and
is used as the home of many historic relics. Among these
may be found the Liberty Bell, which hung in the tower
of the statehouse for many years. It was later removed
from the tower and placed on exhibition in the building.
It has made many journeys to exhibitions in various cities,
such as New Orleans, Atlanta, Chicago, Charleston, Boston,
St. Louis, and San Francisco. The old bell is now shown
in a glass case at the main entrance to Independence Hall.</p>

<p>For ten years, from 1790 to 1800, Philadelphia was the
capital of the United States. In this city Washington and
Adams were inaugurated for their second term as president
and vice-president, and here Adams was inaugurated
president in 1797.</p>

<p>Philadelphia to-day is a great city: great in industry,
great in commerce, and great in near-by resources. Every
street of the old part of the town is rich in historic memories.
William Penn dreamed of a magnificent city, and the
City of Brotherly Love is worthy of her founder's dream.</p>

<h2><a name="ST_LOUIS" id="ST_LOUIS">ST. LOUIS</a></h2>

<p>Soon after Thomas Jefferson became president of the
United States, he bought from France the land known
as Louisiana for $15,000,000. This sum seemed a great
deal of money for a young nation to pay out, but the
Louisiana Purchase covered nearly 900,000 square miles
and extended from the Mississippi River to the Rocky
Mountains and from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada. So
when one stops to think that the United States secured
the absolute control of the Mississippi and more than
doubled its former area at a price less than three cents
an acre, it is easier to understand why Jefferson bought
than why France sold.</p>

<p>When Louisiana became part of the United States in
1803, St. Louis was a straggling frontier village, frequented
mostly by boatmen and trappers. It had been
established as a trading post back in 1764 by a party of
French trappers from New Orleans, and had, from the
first, monopolized the fur trade of the upper Mississippi
and Missouri River country. Here hunters and trappers
brought the spoils of distant forests. Here the surrounding
tribes of Indians came to trade with the friendly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
French. Here countless open boats were loaded with
skins and furs and then floated down the Mississippi.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

        <a name="img_90" id="img_90"></a>
<p class="caption">LOUISIANA PURCHASE</p>
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding this flourishing trade, the growth of
the settlement was slow. In 1803 the population numbered
less than one thousand, made up of French trappers
and hunters, a few other Europeans and Americans,
and a considerable number of Indians, half-breeds, and
negro slaves.</p>

<p>But as soon as Louisiana belonged to the United States,
a new era began in the West. Emigrants from the Eastern
states poured over the Appalachian Mountains. St. Louis
lay right in the path of this overland east-to-west travel.
From here Lewis and Clark started, in 1804, on their
famous exploring trip of nearly two years and a half, up
the Missouri River, to find out for the country what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Louisiana was like. It was here that emigrants headed
for the Oregon country stopped to make final preparations
and lay in supplies. The remote trading post of
the eighteenth century was suddenly transformed into a
wide-awake bustling town.</p>

<p class="caption">MISSISSIPPI RIVER BOATS</p>

<p>Furs were now no longer the only article of trade.
The newly settled Mississippi valley was producing larger
crops each year. Because of the poor roads, overland
transportation to the markets on the Atlantic was out
of the question, and trade was dependent on the great
inland waterways. Early in the century, keel boats and
barges carried the products of field and forest down the
Mississippi. Then came the arrival of the first steamboat,
the real beginning of St. Louis' great prosperity, working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a><br /><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
wonders for this inland commerce whose growth kept pace
with the marvelous development of the rich Middle West.</p>

<p>St. Louis, lying on the west bank of the Mississippi,
between the mouths of the Ohio and Missouri rivers
and not far from the Illinois, became the natural center
of this north-and-south river traffic. By 1860 it was the
most important shipping point west of the Alleghenies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile railroad building had begun in the West.
Ground was broken in 1850 for St. Louis' first railway,
the Missouri Pacific. Other roads were begun during
the next two years. In a short time the whole country
was covered with a network of railroads, and a change in
the methods of transportation followed. The steamboats
were unable to compete with their new rivals in speed&mdash;a
tremendous advantage in carrying passengers and
perishable freight&mdash;and their former importance quickly
grew less.</p>

<p>St. Louis lost nothing by the change. Many of the
cross-continent railroads, following the old pioneer trails,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
met here. To-day more than twenty-five railroads enter
the city, connecting it with the remotest parts of the
United States as well as with Canada and Mexico.</p>

<p>St. Louis now has about 700,000 inhabitants and
occupies nearly 65 square miles of land, which slopes
gradually from the water's edge to the plateau that
stretches for miles beyond the western limits of the city.
The city is laid out in broad straight streets, crossing
each other at right angles wherever possible and numbered
north and south from Market Street.</p>

<p>The shopping district lies mainly between Broadway,&mdash;the
fifth street from the river,&mdash;Twelfth Street, Pine
Street, and Franklin Avenue. The financial center is on
Fourth Street and Broadway, while Washington Avenue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
between Fourth and Eighteenth streets, is one of the
greatest &ldquo;wholesale rows&rdquo; in the West.</p>

<p>Besides its public schools&mdash;which include a teachers'
college&mdash;and private schools, St. Louis has two higher
institutions of learning, Washington University and
St. Louis University.</p>

<p>Among the most important public buildings in the
business section are the municipal court building, the
city hall, the courthouse, and the public library.</p>

<p>The St. Louis Union Station, used by all railroads
entering the city, is one of the largest and finest stations
in the world. Pneumatic tubes connect it with the post
office and the customhouse, while underground driveways
and passages for handling bulky freight, express, and
mail matter radiate from it in all directions.</p>

<p class="caption">THE UNION STATION</p>

<p>Almost directly west of the business section, on the
outskirts of the city, lies Forest Park, the largest of
St. Louis' many recreation grounds. It covers more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
thirteen hundred acres of field and forest land, left largely
in a natural state. Here is the City Art Museum, which
was part of the Art Palace of the world's fair held in
St. Louis in 1904 to celebrate the centennial of the
Louisiana Purchase.</p>

<p>The beautiful Missouri
Botanical Garden,
generally known
as Shaw's Garden, is
open for the use of
the public. Compton
Hill Reservoir Park,
on the South Side,
though small, is one
of the finest in the
city. Its water tower
and basins are a
part of the municipal
water system,
costing more than
$30,000,000. The
city water is pumped
from the Mississippi
River and purified as it passes into great settling basins.</p>

<p>Though St. Louis' attractive houses are found almost
everywhere outside the strictly business quarters, the real
residence section has gradually been growing toward
Forest Park, and many of the city's business men have
built homes in the suburbs beyond the western limits of
the city. One of these suburbs, University City, bids fair
to become America's most beautiful residence town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Unlike most of our large cities, St. Louis has no sharply
defined factory district. Its manufacturing establishments
are distributed over nearly the whole city. An important
part of its manufacturing interests centers on the eastern
bank of the Mississippi in the city's Illinois suburbs.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>The industrial development of these Illinois suburbs
was greatly increased by the opening of the Eads Bridge
in 1874. Before this time there had been no bridge connection
over the Mississippi. Passengers and freight ferries
had plied regularly between St. Louis and her suburbs
across the river, but there were seasons when floating
ice made the river impassable, sometimes cutting off
communication between the two shores for days.</p>

<p>The Eads Bridge is 6220 feet long and is so built that
the railroad tracks cross it on a level lower than the carriage
drives and foot paths. With its completion, communication
between opposite sides of the river became as easy
as between different parts of the city.</p>

        title="see caption" />
<p class="caption">THE EADS BRIDGE</p>
</div>

<p>Other bridges have since been built. In 1890 the
Merchants Bridge, used solely by railroads, was built across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the Mississippi three miles
to the north of Eads Bridge,
and now there is the McKinley
Bridge between the two.
In addition to these the city
is building a bridge which,
when completed, will be
open to traffic without toll
charges.</p>

<p>Among the Illinois suburbs
thus brought into
closer touch with the western
side of the river are
East St. Louis,&mdash;a growing
city of about 75,000,&mdash;Venice,
Madison, Granite
City, and Belleville. Being
principally manufacturing
communities, these cities
contribute in no small degree
to St. Louis' importance
as an industrial center.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">A MISSOURI COAL MINE</p>
</div>

<p>St. Louis' importance,
however, is mainly due to
the city's favorable location
at the heart of one of the
world's richest river valleys.
The vast natural resources
of the Middle West are at
her command. Raw materials
of every kind abound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a><br /><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
almost at her door. Missouri ranks high as an agricultural
and mining state. Its position in the great corn
belt makes hog raising a highly profitable industry. The
prairies to the north furnish extensive grazing areas for
cattle. The Ozark Mountains to the southwest afford
excellent pasturage for sheep and yield lumber as well
as great quantities of lead, zinc, and other minerals. In
addition, the state has large deposits of soft coal, while
only the Mississippi separates St. Louis from the unlimited
supply of the Illinois coal fields. As a result,
the cost of manufacturing is low and the city's many
and varied industries thrive. Chief among these is the
manufacture of boots and shoes. Though this business
is comparatively young in the West, St. Louis already
ranks among the three leading footwear-producing cities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of the country, turning out over $50,000,000 worth of
boots and shoes yearly. Most of these are of the heavier
type made for country trade, but the output of finer footwear
is steadily increasing.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

        alt="see caption"
        title="see caption" />
<p class="caption">MAKING SHOES</p>
</div>

<p>Next in importance are the tobacco, meat-packing, and
malt-liquor industries. St. Louis is one of the leading
cities in the country in the manufacture of tobacco. The
meat-packing establishments, including those in East St.
Louis, hold fourth place among America's great packing
centers. Its mammoth breweries lead the country in the
output of beer. Flour mills, foundries, and sugar refineries
also do an immense business. Street and railroad cars,
stoves of all kinds, paints, oils, and white lead are made
in scores of factories, while hundreds of other industries
flourish in the city, making it one of the greatest workshops
in the United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">MULES IN A STOCKYARD</p>
</div>

<p>Important as St. Louis is as a manufacturing city, it is
even more noted as a distributing center, its location making
it the natural commercial metropolis of the Mississippi
valley. It markets not only its own manufactures but
products which represent every section of the country.
The vast territory to the west and southwest depends
almost entirely on St. Louis for its supply of dry goods
and groceries. Other staples are boots and shoes, tobacco,
hardware, timber, cotton, breadstuffs, cattle, and hogs.</p>

<p>In the handling of furs St. Louis leads the cities of
the world. She also holds a high place among the great
grain markets. In this country her annual receipts of
corn, wheat, and oats are exceeded only by those of
Chicago and Minneapolis. Shipments of grain and breadstuffs
to Central and South America, Cuba, Great Britain,
and Germany constitute the city's leading exports.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>As a live-stock market it is no less important. The
National Stockyards, located on the Illinois side of the
river, contain several hundred acres. Though packing
houses and slaughtering houses occupy some of this land,
the main part is covered with sheds, pens, and enclosures
for the reception and sale of live animals. Millions of
cattle, hogs, and sheep are handled here every year.
St. Louis also buys and sells hundreds of thousands of
horses and mules, being the largest market for draft
animals in the world.</p>

<p>Just as the frontier trading post of the eighteenth
century grew into the thriving river port of the nineteenth,
so the river port of the nineteenth century has
developed into one of the leading railroad and commercial
centers of the twentieth. And the fourth city of America
in size is now St. Louis.</p>

<h2><a name="BOSTON" id="BOSTON">BOSTON</a></h2>

<p>Let us take a trip to New England and visit Boston.
Boston is New England's chief city in size, in population,
in historic interest, and in importance. It is the capital of
Massachusetts and the fifth city in size in the United
States.</p>

<p>If we were going to visit some far-away cousins whom
we had never seen, we should surely want to know something
about their age, their appearance, and their habits.
Would it not be just as interesting to find out these
things about the city we are to see on our journey?</p>

<p>In the early days the Indians called the district where
Boston now stands Shawmut, or &ldquo;living waters.&rdquo; The
first white man to come to Shawmut was William Blackstone,
a hermit who made his home on the slope of what
is now Beacon Hill. Though Blackstone liked to be
alone, he was unselfish. So when he heard that the settlers
of a Puritan colony not far away were suffering for
want of pure water, he went to their governor, John Winthrop,
&ldquo;acquainted him with the excellent spring of water
that was on his land and invited him and his followers
thither.&rdquo; Blackstone's offer was gladly accepted. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a><br /><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Puritans purchased Shawmut from the Indians and in
1630 began their new settlement, which they named
Boston in honor of the English town which had been the
home of some of their leading men.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">MAP OF BOSTON AND ITS VICINITY</p>
</div>

<p>Originally Boston was a little irregular peninsula of
scarcely 700 acres, entirely cut off from the mainland at
high tide. It did not take the colonists long, however, to
outgrow these narrow quarters. They soon filled in the
marshes and coves with land from the hills. They spread
out over two small islands and made them part of Boston.
Then, one by one, they took in neighboring settlements.
And from this start Boston has grown, until to-day it has
an area of about 43 square miles and a population of
nearly 700,000.</p>

<p>We must get a clear idea of these various districts of
Boston. If not, we shall be puzzled to meet friends from
Roxbury or Dorchester and hear them say that they live
in Boston. There is Boston proper, the old Boston before
it annexed its neighbors; East Boston, comprising two
islands in the harbor which joined Boston in 1635 and
1637; then, annexed from time to time, come Roxbury,
Dorchester, Charlestown,&mdash;the scene of the Battle of
Bunker Hill,&mdash;West Roxbury, and Brighton; and last,
Hyde Park, which, by the vote of its people and the citizens
of Boston, joined the city in November, 1911. These
have all kept their original names, but have given up their
local governments to share Boston's larger privileges and
advantages. So remember that when we meet friends
from Roxbury, West Roxbury, Dorchester, Brighton, East
Boston, South Boston, or Hyde Park, they are all Boston
people. The children from these districts would resent it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
if they were not known as Boston boys and girls just as
much as those who live in the very heart of the city.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p class="caption">THE WASHINGTON STREET TUNNEL</p>
</div>

<p>While we have been reading all this, our boat has been
drawing closer to the city, and now we must gather up our
wraps and bags and be ready to start out. We see a very
busy harbor, its noisy tugs drawing the sullen-looking coal
barges; its graceful
schooners loaded to
the water's edge
with lumber; and
its fishing boats with
their dirty sails, not
attractive but doing
the work that has
placed Boston first in
importance as a fishing
port. Crowded
steamers and ferryboats
pass swiftly
by, while huge ocean
steamships may be seen poking their noses out from their
docks at East Boston and South Boston or heading toward
the city with their thousands of eager passengers.</p>

<p>As we hurry along with our fellow travelers we must
decide how best to reach our hotel. There are taxicabs
and carriages for some; electric cars, both surface and
elevated, for the many. Boston has excellent car and train
service. The Boston Elevated Railway Company controls
most of the car lines in the city as well as in the outlying
towns. This makes it possible for us to ride for
a nickel an average distance of at least five miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a><br /><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

        title="see caption" />
<p class="caption">A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF BOSTON</p>
</div>

<p>A line of elevated trains running across the city connects
West Roxbury on the south with Charlestown on
the north. Some of these trains pass through the Washington
Street tunnel, from which numerous well-lighted,
well-ventilated stations lead directly to the shopping and
business section of the city. On this elevated road are two
huge terminal stations, into which rush countless surface
cars, bringing from all points north and south the immense
crowds of suburbanites who come to Boston proper each
day, to work or on pleasure bent.</p>

<p>Chelsea folks come to the city by ferry or by electric
car, while those from East Boston have two ferry lines as
well as a tunnel for cars under the harbor.</p>

<p>The city proper has two immense union railroad depots,
the North and the South station, where hundreds of local,
as well as long-distance, trains leave and arrive each day.
The railroads entering Boston are the Boston &amp; Albany,
which, by means of the New York Central lines, connects
with the West; the Boston &amp; Maine, leading northward
to Maine and Canada; and the New York, New Haven &amp;
Hartford, which connects by way of New York with various
points in the South.</p>

<p>All these transportation advantages have made Boston
an excellent place in which to live, as its suburbs afford
the benefits of country life while yet they are within a
few minutes' ride of a big city.</p>

<p>There are several ways in which we can see Boston.
We may climb into one of the great sight-seeing autos
and ride from point to point while the man with the megaphone
calls our attention to the interesting landmarks
and gives their history; we can engage a guide who will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
take us from place to place; or we can simply follow the
directions of our guide book.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">THE SOUTH STATION</p>
</div>

<p>No trip to Boston is complete without a visit to the
State House, or capitol, whose gilded dome is seen glittering
in the sunlight by day and sparkling with electric
lights by night. It is situated on Beacon Hill, the highest
point of land in the city proper. Up to 1811 one peak of
the hill was as high as the gilded dome is now, and on its
summit a beacon was set up as early as 1634, to warn
the people in the surrounding country of approaching disaster.
It seems, however, that the beacon was never used,
and during the Revolution the British pulled it down and
built a fort in its place.</p>

<p>Even if there were no gilded dome on the State House,
the building itself is handsome enough to attract attention.
It was designed in 1795 by Charles Bulfinch, a
famous architect. The front of the building to-day is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
historic Bulfinch front. But as Boston grew, so also did
the State House, and additions were made in 1853, in
1889, and in 1915, until now we have the impressive
building we are about to enter.</p>

<p class="caption">DRILLING ON THE COMMON</p>
</div>

<p>But stop after climbing the main steps, turn around,
and look at the green field before you. This is Boston
Common, the famous Boston Common where the people
of long ago used to pasture their cows; where the British
in the early days of the Revolution set up their fortified
camps during the siege of Boston; and where, at the present
time, the admiring relatives of the high-school boys
assemble yearly to see them go through their military
drill. Situated as it is in the very heart of the city,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Boston Common is the resting place, the breathing place,
for thousands. It is the people's playground. Fireworks,
band concerts, public speaking, all prove that its public
character has never been lost, and that it is now as much
of a Common as it was in 1649, when it was first laid out.
By a wise clause in the city charter, this Common cannot
be sold or leased without the consent of the citizens.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">A CORNER OF THE COMMON, SHOWING THE SHAW MEMORIAL</p>
</div>

<p>The Common contains many memorials erected by a
grateful people. The most conspicuous is the Army and
Navy Monument, which reaches far above the trees.
Directly opposite the State House is the Shaw Memorial,
a wonderful bronze bas-relief by Saint Gaudens, showing
the gallant Colonel Shaw and his colored regiment.</p>

<p>The sight of Shaw's earnest young face amid his dusky
followers prepares us for entering Doric Hall in the State
House, set apart as a memorial for those who died in their
country's cause. We look with awe and reverence on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
flags whose worn and tattered edges tell plainly of the
struggles of their bearers and defenders.</p>

<p class="caption">THE STATE-HOUSE CODFISH</p>
</div>

<p>Let us peep into the Senate chamber and into the hall
of the House of Representatives with its historic codfish
suspended from the ceiling, a reminder of a most humble
source of Massachusetts' wealth. We will then climb to
the dome and see Boston before a cold east wind sweeps
suddenly in, covering the city with fog and making all
misty and uncertain. As we reach the highest point, it
really seems as if the fog had rolled in, but it is only
a fog of smoke from the many chimneys of the city's
countless factories.</p>

<p>As our eyes get accustomed to the view, the mist seems
to roll away, and the city lies before us. That blue line
to the east is the harbor, and between us and the harbor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a><br /><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
is the business section of Boston, the noisy, throbbing
heart of a big city. Directly back of us as we stand
facing the water is the West End, once a fashionable
section where Boston's
literary men
held court, now a
district largely given
over to tenements
and lodging-houses.
To the north and
south lie the North
and South ends; the
former, the oldest
of the city and the
great foreign district

<p>That broad winding
stream of water
that we see is the
Charles River. Just
beyond it to the
north is Charlestown,
its Bunker
Hill Monument towering up for all to see. The city of
Cambridge is just across the Charles River to the west,
and next to it, skirting the southern bank of the river,
is the district of Brighton. South Boston, Roxbury, West
Roxbury, Hyde Park, and Dorchester lie toward the south.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Among the many islands in the harbor, East Boston is the
most crowded and the closest to the city proper. Towards
the southwest, between
us and the
Charles, lies Back
Bay, once tidewater
but now filled in
and made into land.
Look around you
and notice how the
surrounding parts of
Boston form a chain
about their parent,
a chain broken only
by Cambridge&mdash;the
seat of Harvard
University&mdash;and
Brookline,&mdash;Massachusetts'
wealthiest
town,&mdash;which refuses
to become a
city or to join its
larger neighbor.</p>

<p>As we leave the
State House, a few
minutes' walk brings
us to the heart of
Boston's great shopping
district and to
Boston's leading business street. You will be glad to
know that this street is called neither Main Street nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a><br /><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Broadway, but Washington Street. Originally, part was
known as Orange, part as Marlborough, and part as Newbury.
But when, at the close of the Revolution, Washington
rode through the city at the head of a triumphal
procession, the people renamed the street along which he
passed, Washington, and so it is called to-day in all its
ten miles of length. Washington Street is very narrow
in parts, and as it is lined on both sides with some of
Boston's largest and finest department stores, it presents
a very animated appearance on a week-day afternoon.</p>

<p class="caption">THE CITY OF BOSTON</p>
</div>

<p>Stop for a moment on busy Newspaper Row. Here a
bystander may read the news of the world as it is posted
hourly upon the great bulletin boards of the various
newspaper offices.</p>

<p>Parallel to Washington Street, and connected with it
by many short streets, is Tremont Street, another old historic
road. Originally Tremont Street was a path outlined
by William Blackstone's cows on their way to pasture;
now it is second only to Washington Street in importance.</p>

<p>Washington Street is really the main dividing line between
the retail and wholesale parts of the city. The
water front is the great wholesale section. Here there is
a constant odor of leather in the air, and great heavy
wagons laden with hides are continually passing to and
from the wharves and stations. When we stop and consider
that Boston and the neighboring cities of Brockton
and Lynn are among the largest shoe-manufacturing cities
in the world, then we do not wonder at the leather we
see. It is no vain boast to say that in every quarter of
the world may be seen shoes that once, in the form of
leather, were carted through the streets of Boston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>What is true of leather is also true of cotton and wool.
Lowell, Fall River, and New Bedford are calling for
cotton to be made into cloth in their busy mills, while
Lawrence is the greatest wool-manufacturing city in the
country. Boston, with its harbor and great railroad
terminals, is constantly receiving these materials and
distributing them to these cities.</p>

<p>The finished cloths often return to Boston to be cut
and made into clothes, and an army of men and women
cut and sew from day to day on garments for people far
distant from Boston as well as for those near home.</p>

<p>One glance at the wharves along Atlantic Avenue and
Commercial Street and our glimpse of busy Boston will
be ended. Here are wharves and piers jutting out into
the harbor, where are boats of every kind from every
land. New York alone among American cities outranks
Boston in the value of her foreign commerce. From one
large steamer thousands of green bananas are being carried.
They will be sold to the many fruit dealers, from those
whose show windows are visions of beauty, to the Greek
or Italian peddler who pushes his hand cart out into the
suburbs.</p>

<p>Some of the steamers are already puffing with importance
as if to hasten the steps of travelers who are on
their way to board ship for different ports in the South,
for Nova Scotia and other points north, or perhaps to
cross the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Two of the wharves&mdash;T Wharf and the new fishing pier&mdash;are
devoted to the fishing industry. From the banks
of Newfoundland and the other splendid fishing grounds
along the coast from Cape Cod to Labrador, fishermen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
are constantly bringing their catches to Boston, their chief
market. In addition, Gloucester and other fishing ports
re-ship most of the fish brought to them to the Boston
market. Is it any wonder that Boston ranks first of all
the cities of the United States in the fish trade? In 1910
Boston received and marketed $10,500,000 worth of fish&mdash;more
than any other American city, and exceeded by
only one other port in the world.</p>

<p>In this neighborhood too is a tablet marking the site
of Griffin's Wharf, where the Boston Tea Party of the
Revolution took place. We remember how the people of
Boston refused to pay the tax on tea; how the shiploads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a><br /><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of tea sent from England remained unloaded at the wharf;
and how, finally, after an indignation meeting had been held
at the Old South Meeting
House, a band of
men and boys, disguised
as Indians, boarded the
vessels, ripped open the
chests, and emptied all
the cargo into the harbor.
It was rightly called
the Boston Tea Party.</p>

<p class="caption">OLD NORTH CHURCH</p>
</div>

<p>As we are so close to
the North End, we may
as well go there at once.
The North End is the
oldest section of Boston.
It was here that Samuel
Adams, John Hancock,
Paul Revere, and other
patriots had their headquarters
during the troublous
times before the
Revolution. Paul Revere,
of whose famous
ride we have all read
in Longfellow's poem,
lived and carried on his
business in this very district.
If we wish, we can see his home as well as the
famous Old North Church, where his friend hung the
lanterns warning him of the movements of the British.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>But to-day there is little else to remind us of the past.
As we cross North Square and see the gesticulating,
dark-skinned men, the stout, gayly kerchiefed women in
the doorways, and the hordes of dark-eyed children on
street and sidewalk, we wonder if by mistake we have
not entered some city in southern Europe. To-day the
North End of Boston is the great foreign section of the
city. Here live the Jews, Italians, and Russians. They
tell us that more than one third of the entire population
of the city are foreigners.</p>

<p>But when a group of boys rushes toward us, each begging
to be our guide to the Old North Church, to Paul
Revere's house, or to the famous Copp's Hill Burying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Ground,&mdash;all for a nickel,&mdash;we are sure we are in America
and gladly follow our leader through the narrow, crooked
streets.</p>

<p>From among the parents of these children come the
fruit peddlers, the clothing makers, the street musicians,
and the great army
of laborers which
helps to keep the
city in repair.</p>

<p>Are we tired of
the noise and confusion
of the crowded
tenement district?
If so, let us go to
the broad streets
and beautiful parks
of the Back Bay,
the abode of the
wealthy. The Back
Bay, as its name suggests,
was originally
the Back Cove, and
where these houses
now stand, the
waves once danced in glee. But Boston filled in the
marshes and coves and laid out fine streets on the newly
made land. Here is the famous Beacon Street, and parallel
to it is Boston's most beautiful thoroughfare,&mdash;Commonwealth
Avenue,&mdash;two hundred and twenty feet
wide, with a parkway running through the center. See
the children with their nurses, playing on the grass or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
roller skating on the broad sidewalks, apparently no
happier than the little ones of the North End.</p>

<p class="caption">PAUL REVERE'S HOUSE</p>
</div>

<p>But it is not merely its fine streets and homes that
make the Back Bay the handsomest part of the city. In
this section are many of Boston's finest public buildings.
Come to Copley Square, the most beautiful in the city.
Here stands Trinity Church,&mdash;Phillips Brooks' church,&mdash;a
magnificent structure of granite with sandstone trimmings.
Phillips Brooks was for a brief year the Protestant
Episcopal bishop of Massachusetts. He was loved by
those of all denominations. After his death the citizens of
Boston united in erecting a splendid memorial, in token
of their love for him and their gratitude for his services.
The statue is by Augustus Saint Gaudens and is considered
one of the greatest works of that great sculptor.</p>

<p>On Copley Square we see also the New Old South
Church and the Boston Public Library.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Boston is very proud of her public library, and rightly
so, for it is not only one of the finest buildings in Boston
but also one of the finest libraries in the country. Look at
the magnificent marble staircase, the curiously inlaid floor
and ceiling of the
entrance hall, the
graceful statues,
the wonderful paintings,
and the fine
courtyard with its
sparkling fountain.
On the floors above
are the children's
room with its low
tables and chairs
and rows upon rows
of interesting books;
Bates Hall, a most
attractive reading
room; Sargent's mystical
paintings; and
Edwin A. Abbey's
series of paintings,
which are called
&ldquo;The Quest of the
Holy Grail.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">PHILLIPS BROOKS' MEMORIAL</p>
</div>

<p>Besides the main library there are branch libraries or
reading rooms in every section of the city. Altogether
the Boston Public Library contains over one million
volumes, making it the largest circulating library in the
United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>But there are other buildings in the Back Bay which
rival those on Copley Square. We should see the Christian
Science church with its massive dome; the Boston Opera
House; and Symphony Hall, the home of the famous
Boston Symphony Orchestra, known the country over.</p>

<p>The Boston Museum of Fine Arts stood originally on
Copley Square, but in 1909 a new and magnificent building
was opened, farther out in the Back Bay. Not far
from the new museum stands the Harvard Medical School,
an imposing group of five white-marble buildings.</p>

<p>But now we are tired of buildings, so come into the
Public Garden&mdash;the gateway to the Back Bay&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
while you rest I will tell you about Boston's parks.
Sitting in the beautiful Public Garden, it will not be
hard for you to believe that the park system of Boston
is the finest in the country. The first park was, as we
have seen, the Common. For many years the Common
was not a place of beauty. Edward Everett Hale spoke
of it as a &ldquo;pasture for cows, a playground for children,
a training ground for the militia, a place for beating
carpets.&rdquo; Many changes have taken place on the Common
since the old days, but two of the characteristics still remain.
Boston Common is still a playground for children,
and military drills are still to be seen there from time
to time.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/img_129.jpg" width="600" height="481"
        alt="see caption"
        title="see caption" />
<p class="caption">BOSTON PUBLIC LIBRARY</p>
</div>

<p>The Common is just across Charles Street from the
Public Garden&mdash;the second great park to be laid out in
Boston. This Public Garden was reclaimed from the
marshes, and at present covers about twenty-four and a
half acres. It is truly a garden, and during the spring,
summer, and fall nearly every species of beautiful flower,
plant, and shrub may here be seen&mdash;a riot of color and
beauty.</p>

<p>But the people of Boston did not stop even with the
Public Garden. The city of Boston has, besides, numerous
small squares at intervals through the city. She also has
vast tracts of rural land, which, unlike the Public Garden,
are left to their own wild beauty. Owing to Boston's
expanse of water front, it is possible for her to have both
inland and ocean parks, where may be found all kinds
of open-air sports and recreations.</p>

<p>Some of the most important of these parks are Franklin
Park, the Fens, the Arnold Arboretum, Marine Park, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the Charles River Basin. In the Arnold Arboretum, the
property of Harvard College, are rare shrubs and trees.
Fortunate is the one who can visit it in lilac time, when
scores of varieties of lilacs, both white and many shades
of violet, scent the air with their delicate perfumes.</p>

<p>The best example of the ocean parkways is Marine Park.
There one finds extensive bathhouses, a good beach, lawns,
and a long pier extending several hundred feet out into
the water. Connected with Marine Park by a long bridge
is Castle Island, the site of Fort Independence.</p>

<p>The Charles River Basin is a popular promenade. This
river, until recently, showed for many hours of the day
the uncovered mud flats of low tide. Now by means of
a dam it has been turned into a great fresh-water lake.
Cambridge and Boston have laid out parkways on either
side of the river, and before long further improvements
will make this basin even more attractive.</p>

<p>Through the influence of Boston the surrounding cities
and towns have given certain large areas of great natural
beauty to form the Metropolitan Park System. This Metropolitan
Park System consists of 3 forest reserves of
7000 acres of woodland, 30 miles of river park, 10 miles
of seacoast, and 40 miles of connecting parkways.</p>

<p>Two great ocean parks in the system are Revere Beach
and Nantasket, both favorite summer resorts, while the
most noted inland reservations are the Blue Hills and
the Middlesex Fells.</p>

<p>A Roman matron of long ago, when asked to show her
jewels, pointed to her sons with pride, saying, &ldquo;These are
my jewels.&rdquo; And so it is with Boston. She is proud of her
history, her fine public buildings, her busy thoroughfares,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
her parks, her great centers of industry, and her commerce;
but most of all, she is proud of her more than
ninety thousand school children.</p>

<p>From the earliest times Boston's schools have ranked
among the best in the country. The first public school
in America was established in Dorchester, and some of
the greatest educators, such as Horace Mann and Charles
W. Eliot, have been associated with Boston or its suburbs.</p>

THE HARVARD YARD</p>
</div>

<p>Boston is the home of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, a famous training college in applied sciences;
Simmons College for women; the Harvard Medical College;
Boston College (Roman Catholic); Boston University;
the Normal Art School; the Conservatory of Music;
the Emerson School of Oratory; and other schools of
high standing. Harvard, the oldest and largest university<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
in the country, has its home in Cambridge. Radcliffe, a
college for women, whose pupils receive the same courses
of instruction as the students in Harvard, is also in
Cambridge. Tufts College is in the neighboring city of
Medford, while in the beautiful hill town of Wellesley,
a suburb of Boston, is Wellesley College, a woman's
college of high rank.</p>

<p>But now, if we hurry, we shall be just in time to see
the children flocking in crowds to one of their many playgrounds.
Here they find swings and other apparatus for
sport; and here they may play tennis, baseball, or football
in the spring, summer, and fall. In the winter months
they may make use of the ice, which is kept in good condition
for the skater. In the various districts, also, are
swimming pools and indoor gymnasiums, where old and
young meet for recreation as well as for physical training.</p>

<p>Having seen Boston at work and at play, we now ask
ourselves where the food comes from to feed this vast
multitude. Its meats, flour, and grain of all kinds are
brought into its huge freight stations from the West. Its
great ocean trade with the ports in the South as well as
in Europe and Asia supplies other food necessities and
luxuries. New England is a great dairy center, and much
of the city's milk, butter, and other dairy products comes
to Boston each morning from New Hampshire, Vermont,
and western Massachusetts. The purity of the milk is
carefully watched, and it is impossible to buy even a pint
of milk in anything but a sealed jar.</p>

<p>Boston's drinking-water is equally well guarded. The
water, as well as the sewage, is under the control of the
Metropolitan Water and Sewage Commission. There is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
high-pressure distributing station at Chestnut Hill, which
gives power sufficient to force water to the highest of
Boston's buildings.</p>

<p>The sewage of the down-town sections of the city is
collected in a main drainage system, pumped through a
tunnel under Dorchester Bay to Moon Island, held in
large reservoirs, and discharged into the water when the
tide is going out. The sewage of the outlying districts is
conveyed to various places in the harbor and discharged
into the water at a depth of thirty or forty feet, where
it can be quickly carried out to sea.</p>

<p>Our stay in Boston is now at an end. Not only have
we traveled over many miles of her streets and visited
her famous State House, her busy wharves, and her interesting
playgrounds, but we have reviewed many events
of her thrilling history. What of all we have seen or
heard is it most important for us to remember? First,
that Boston is the fifth city in size in the United States;
second, that she is the capital city of Massachusetts;
third, that she is the chief trade center of New England;
and fourth, that among America's cities she ranks second
only to New York in foreign commerce. Then we must
not forget the important place she holds in the early
history of our country.</p>

<p>As we traveled into Boston, so we will journey out
again. And with the last of the great city fading from
our view, we call to mind the large-hearted Blackstone
and say to ourselves, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>&ldquo;Quite a change from the hermit's

<h2><a name="CLEVELAND" id="CLEVELAND">CLEVELAND</a></h2>

<p>In the days that followed the Revolution, Connecticut
claimed certain lands south of Lake Erie. A large
part of these she sold to the Connecticut Land Company,
who wanted to colonize the country and establish New
Connecticut.</p>

<p>It was in 1796 that the Connecticut Land Company
sent General Moses Cleaveland west, to survey the land
and choose a site for a settlement. After surveying about
sixty miles, Cleaveland fixed on a plateau just south of
Lake Erie, where the Cuyahoga River runs into the lake.
Soon the settlement was laid out with a square and two
main streets and was very properly called Cleaveland.
The name was spelled with an <i>a</i>, just as Moses Cleaveland
spelled his name. There is no <i>a</i> in the city's name
to-day, the story being that the extra letter was dropped,
and the new spelling adopted, in 1831, through a newspaper's
claiming that the <i>a</i> would not fit conveniently
into its headline.</p>

<p>At first the new settlement did not prosper. The soil
was poor, and commerce along the Ohio River attracted immigrants
into the interior. Those that stayed in Cleveland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
had a hard struggle with fever. The mouth of the Cuyahoga
River was frequently choked with sand, making the
water in the river's bed stagnant and furnishing a breeding
place for malaria-carrying mosquitoes. During the summer
and autumn of 1798 affairs were in a desperate condition.
Every one in the settlement was miserable. There was no
flour, and for two months Nathaniel Doan's boy was the
only person strong enough to go to the house of one James
Kingsbury, on the highlands back of the town, for corn.
This he carried to a gristmill at Newburgh, six miles to
the south, and had it ground into meal for the sick.</p>

<p>Besides the suffering caused by fever, there was danger
of Indian attacks and the ever-present dread of the wolves
and bears which prowled about the settlement, so that no
one dared go out at night unarmed, and no door was left
without a loaded musket to guard it.</p>

<p>But in spite of the dangers of these early years, the
settlers for the most part led a busy, happy life. The
women especially had their hands full&mdash;keeping their
houses clean and neat; doing the cooking and baking;
spinning, weaving, cutting out, and sewing the clothes
for their families (usually large) and knitting their stockings.
Then there were the sick to be visited and nursed,
and the neighbors to be helped with their quilting.</p>

<p>When a new settler arrived, all the men would pitch
in and help in the &ldquo;cabin raising,&rdquo; finishing the work in
short order. They often ended up with a jolly dance,
though the music was sometimes nothing more than the
whistling of the dancers.</p>

<p>For the first ten years Cleveland was only a hamlet
of a few dozen people. Still it continued to exist, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
in 1815 was incorporated as a village. Another year saw
the first bank started, and before long its first newspaper
was printed. This paper was supposed to be a weekly,
but often appeared only every ten, twelve, or fifteen days,
at the convenience of the editor.</p>

<p>Already, in supplying her own needs, Cleveland was
laying the foundation for some of her future industries.
In fact, soon after the settlement was founded, Nathaniel
Doan built a blacksmith shop on what is now Superior
Avenue. Though the shop was only a rude affair built
of logs, it deserves the name of Cleveland's first manufacturing
plant. Here Nathaniel Doan not only shod the
few horses which needed his services but made tools as
well. A gristmill and sawmill came next, and then began
the building of small schooners.</p>

<p>In the early years of the nineteenth century there was
practically no way of communicating with the settlements
on the Ohio River. And except for an occasional party
of French and Indians, there was no means of hearing
from Detroit. In 1818, however, regular stage routes
began to be opened. One line went to Columbus, one to
Norwalk, and one to Painesville. This last route advertised
that its stage would leave Cleveland at two on Friday
afternoon and would reach Painesville on Saturday morning
at eight&mdash;a journey which to-day can easily be made
by automobile in a little more than an hour. Turnpikes
soon displaced these rough stage routes, and over them
great six-horse wagons drew freight into Cleveland.</p>

<p>Though all these things helped Cleveland, it was still
nothing more than a village&mdash;and so primitive a village
that when two hundred dollars was voted for improvements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
one of the old citizens asked, &ldquo;What on earth can the trustees
find in this village to spend two hundred dollars on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finally, came two events which were the making of
Cleveland. In 1827 the Ohio Canal was opened from
Cleveland to Akron and later to the mouth of the Scioto
River, which flows into the Ohio at Portsmouth; and in
1828 a channel was cut through the bar at the mouth
of the Cuyahoga River. Consider what this meant to
Cleveland. The Ohio Canal connected the village with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the Ohio River, thus putting Cleveland in touch with the
rich coal, iron, oil, and coke lands of western Pennsylvania.
Travelers, too, found the canal boats much better
to journey on than the old stagecoaches.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

        alt="see caption"
        title="see caption" />
<p class="caption">A RIVER SCENE</p>
</div>

<p>The deepening of the mouth of the Cuyahoga River
gave Cleveland a harbor and a place to build the enormous
docks which to-day line the river's shore for the last few
miles of its length. A few years earlier an effort to protect
lake vessels had been made by building a pier out
into the lake near the sand bar. The lake soon tore the
pier to pieces, however, and the vessels still had to be
hauled over the bar to safety. But with the sand bar cut,
boats could sail in and out of the river at their pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Splendid results followed. The population increased,
frame houses gradually came to take the place of log
cabins, business greatly improved, and in 1836 Cleveland
became a city.</p>

<p>The year 1851 saw a great celebration in Cleveland over
the opening of the first railroad. This brought added
prosperity to the city. Then, too, iron ore began to arrive
by water from the Lake Superior mines. At the same time
more and more coal was being received. The manufacturers
commenced to appreciate the tremendous advantages
of living at a natural meeting place of these two great
necessities. Cleveland awoke to a new business activity.</p>

<p>Then came the Civil War, and the manufacturing of
iron products for the government crowded Cleveland's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
factories. During the years of the war the refining of
coal oil developed into one of the city's leading industries.
It was then that the great Standard Oil Company
was organized. Many came to the city, attracted by
these growing industries, so that what proved a disastrous
period in many sections of our country was really a
time of growth for Cleveland.</p>

<p>Soon after the war East Cleveland was annexed to the
city, and in 1873 Newburgh too became a part of Cleveland.
Then, in 1893, West Cleveland and Brooklyn were
taken in, and when Cleveland celebrated the anniversary
of its founding in 1896, it had become a city of great
importance in the country.</p>

<p>At present
Cleveland extends
for over
14 miles along
Lake Erie and
covers more than
50 square miles.
The larger part
of the city lies
to the east of
the Cuyahoga
River. The valley
of this river
is filled with car
tracks, lumber
yards, car shops,
coal sheds, ore
docks, and shipyards.
Being in

center of the street railway lines is Monumental Square,
which lies about a mile from the lake shore. From this
square radiate the streets in a fan shape, at every angle
from northeast to west. Euclid Avenue is Cleveland's most
famous street, having for years enjoyed the reputation of
being one of the country's finest avenues. The lower end
is taken up with business, but farther out are many splendid
residences surrounded by extensive and beautifully
kept lawns. Cleveland is called the Forest City, and it is
to the old trees which grace its parks and line both sides
of Euclid Avenue that it owes its name. Another important
business street is Superior Avenue, which runs
through the main business portion of the city.</p>

<p>Though Cleveland is a beautiful city, its importance
really lies in the fact of its occupying just the position
that it does. Being on Lake Erie puts it in touch with
the copper fields of Michigan, the iron mines of Minnesota
and Michigan, and the huge forests along the Great
Lakes. Through railroad connections it is also in touch
with the coal, oil, and
iron supplies of western
Pennsylvania and
Ohio. Thus, lying in
the center of eastern
and western commerce,
Cleveland has
become a great manufacturing
center, and
the Cleveland district
is the largest
ore market in the
world. Lake vessels
bring the ore to
Cleveland's enormous
docks, where huge machines
quickly transfer
it to cars waiting
to carry it to Pittsburgh and other cities.</p>

<p>Cleveland, also, has several blast furnaces and immense
factories of iron and steel supplies. It holds first rank in
America for the making of wire and nails. More ships
are built in the Cleveland district than anywhere else
in the world except in the shipyards on the Clyde River
in Scotland. Then, too, Cleveland makes steel bridges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a><br /><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and buildings, automobiles, and gas ranges. Quantities
of women's clothing are made in Cleveland. Slaughtering
and the wholesale meat-packing business are other
important industries.</p>

<p>It is a simple matter to ship Cleveland's manufactures
in every direction. The main lines of the New York Central
and the Nickel Plate pass through Cleveland, and
it is a terminal city of the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago,
&amp; St. Louis Railroad,&mdash;commonly known as the Big
Four,&mdash;the Pennsylvania, the Erie, the Baltimore &amp; Ohio,
and the Wheeling &amp; Lake Erie railroads. More than this,
Cleveland is the center of a vast network of interurban
electric railways that carry both passengers and freight
and keep the city in hourly communication with the many
smaller cities of northern Ohio.</p>

<p>Cleveland gets its water supply from Lake Erie
through tunnels built out under the lake, which connect
with two intake cribs, one of which is five miles from
the shore. Natural gas, pumped through large mains
from the gas fields of West Virginia, more than 200 miles
away, is sold to the people of Cleveland at 30 cents a
thousand. The street railway service is among the best
in the country, and the fare is lower than in any other
large American city.</p>

<p>Cleveland has excellent educational advantages. Western

noted for its law and medical schools. In Cleveland, also,
are the Case School of Applied Science, the Cleveland
School of Art, St. Ignatius College, the Homeopathic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Medical College, and the University School. The public

numerous small parks and playgrounds in the more congested
districts. A plan for grouping the city's public
buildings about a broad parkway is being carried out.
Several of the buildings are already completed. When
finished, this will be one of the most beautiful and most

<p>All of these things, added to the great possibilities for
occupation offered by the city's many lines of work, have

</div>

<h2><a name="BALTIMORE" id="BALTIMORE">BALTIMORE</a></h2>

<p>Near the head of Chesapeake Bay stands Baltimore, the
largest of our Southern cities and the seventh city in size
in the United States.</p>

<p>Because of her importance as a Southern railroad center
and her excellent harbor on the largest bay of the
Atlantic coast, Baltimore is called &ldquo;The Gateway to the
South.&rdquo; Great ships from all parts of the world unload
their cargoes at her docks and take in return products
from nearly every section of the United States.</p>

<p>The railroads bring to Baltimore vast quantities of iron,
coal, and grain from the West, and up from the South
ships and trains come laden with raw sugar, tobacco,
fruits, and vegetables. Here the oysters, fish, and crabs
from Chesapeake Bay and the products of the rich farm
lands of Maryland and Virginia find a ready market.</p>

<p>Knowing these things, one can surmise what the city's
leading industries and exports must be. Baltimore is the
world's greatest oyster market, she leads the world in the
canning of vegetables and fruits, she is one of the country's
largest banana markets, and more corn is exported from
this city than from anywhere else in America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>Baltimore is a great sugar-refining center, she leads the
world in the making of straw hats, and among her foremost
industries are the manufacture of clothing and the
making of tobacco goods.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">AN OYSTER BOAT</p>
</div>

<p>Thanks to the coal and iron she receives, Baltimore
builds cars, ships, and almost everything made of iron
and steel. Then, too, the city has the largest copper-refining
plant in America.</p>

<p>If this story had been written a few years ago, it
would tell you that Baltimore's streets were narrow, that
miles of them were paved with cobblestones or were not
paved at all, and that the city generally was developing
very slowly. But to-day we have a quite different
Baltimore.</p>

<p class="caption">THE BALTIMORE FIRE</p>
</div>

<p>On February 7th and 8th, 1904, a great fire swept the
business section of the city, destroying $125,000,000 worth
of property. While the ruins were still smoldering, the
courageous people, refusing all help from outside, began
to plan a bigger and better Baltimore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>The work began in the burned part of the city. The
narrow down-town streets were widened and paved, and
new and better buildings took the place of the burned
ones. Most of these new buildings are three or four
stories high, though a few tall ones range from ten to
sixteen stories. Fortunately three of Baltimore's oldest
and most imposing buildings escaped the fire&mdash;the post
office, the city hall, and the courthouse.</p>

<p>Two important streets cross this newly built business

is the chief business thoroughfare, and north and south of
it are the wholesale, financial, and shipping districts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>The city owned little wharf property of importance
before 1904, but the fire made it possible to buy all the
burned district fronting the harbor. This the city purchased
and laid out in a wonderful system of public
wharves and docks open to the commerce of the world.</p>

<p>Pier 4, at the foot of Market Place, has been set aside for
the use of market boats, and here small crafts bring much
of the fruit, vegetables, fish, crabs, and oysters which
make the markets of Baltimore among the most attractive
in the United States. There are eleven of these markets,
and on market days they are a most interesting sight with
their busy jostling crowds all eagerly buying or selling.</p>

<p>But these great improvements in the business center
and along the water front are only part of the good results
which have followed the fire. In past years Baltimore
had many miles of open sewers, an unhealthful arrangement
which caused much sickness. The very year after
the fire, work was begun to do away with this evil, and
to-day the city has a sanitary, up-to-date sewer system.</p>

<p>Another important work of the city-betterment plan
has to do with a stream called Jones Falls, which used to
flow in an open channel right through the center of the
city. This stream now flows through great concrete tubes,
over which is a broad highway running diagonally across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a><br /><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the city, all the way from the docks to the railroad terminal.
Then, too, the city has a new water system, great
enough to supply the entire city with purified water from
Gunpowder River. And besides all these a great dam,
the third longest in the world, has been built across the
Susquehanna River
at McCall Ferry,
furnishing electric
power which lights
the streets, runs the

many splendid old trees bordering the boulevards which
connect them. Two of these parks, Mount Vernon Place
and Eutaw Place, are near the center of Baltimore. The
former is cross shaped, and here stands the famous monument
to George Washington, the first statue erected to his
memory in this country. Eutaw Place is a long parkway
made beautiful with statuary, flowers, fountains, and winding
walks, and on either side stand handsome residences.</p>

<p>Way back in 1634, a company of Catholic pilgrims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
came to America to found a colony where their religion
would not be interfered with. King Charles I of England
granted to these people a certain territory north of the
Potomac River, which he named Maryland in honor of
his wife, Mary, who was also a Catholic. The founder
of the province was Lord Baltimore, and from the very beginning,
settlers of all beliefs were made heartily welcome.</p>

<p>About one hundred years after
the planting of this Catholic colony,
sixty acres of land on the north side
of the Patapsco River was purchased
and laid out for a city. To honor the
generous-hearted founder of Maryland,
the place was named Baltimore.</p>

<p>One of the most thrilling events
in Baltimore's history led to the writing
of our national song&mdash;&ldquo;The
Star-Spangled Banner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Francis Scott Key, of Baltimore, was a prisoner on a
British man-of-war in 1814, when the British attacked
Fort McHenry. Fort McHenry guarded Baltimore, and if
the fort fell, the city too must go. All day the English
ships fired shot and shell at the fort. During all the night
the attack went on. Anxiously Key watched through the
darkness. Could the fort hold out against such a terrible
bombardment? From time to time, by flashes from bursting
bombs, he could see the outlines of the fort. Then
came the dawn. In the early morning light Key saw our
flag still waving, and in his joy he wrote on the back of
an old letter the words of the song that has since become
so famous.</p>

<h2><a name="PITTSBURGH" id="PITTSBURGH">PITTSBURGH</a></h2>

<p>Pittsburgh and New Orleans&mdash;both of vast commercial
importance&mdash;are connected by one of the greatest water
highways in the world. Never were two cities more unlike.
New Orleans, near the mouth of the Mississippi, with its
French and its Southern population, might be termed the
Paris of our country&mdash;this gay, fashionable town, with its
fine opera houses, its noted restaurants, and its brilliant
Mardi Gras pageants. Pittsburgh, on the other hand, at the
head of the Ohio River, in the heart of a famous coal-and-iron
region, is well named the &ldquo;workshop of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many years ago, when the governor of Virginia sent
George Washington to drive the French from the Ohio
valley, there stood, where the Allegheny and Monongahela
rivers unite to form the Ohio River, a small fort which
the French called Fort Duquesne. This fort was captured
in 1758 by the British and renamed Fort Pitt, in honor
of England's great statesman, William Pitt. To-day the
place is known as Pittsburgh, and is the center of the
most extensive iron works in the United States.</p>

<p>At first the little settlement was important as a break
in transportation, for here cargoes were changed from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
lighter boats used on the Allegheny and Monongahela
rivers to the heavier barges on the broad Ohio. Even then
Pittsburgh was recognized as a gateway of the West.</p>

<p>Gradually the settlement became a trading center,
which soon developed into a big, busy, manufacturing
city. Now Pittsburgh has a population of over half a
million and is the eighth city in size in the Union.</p>

<p class="caption">IN A MODERN COAL MINE</p>
</div>

<p>Pittsburgh coal is used all over the country. The near-by
mines form a great underground city, whose dark passageways,
far below the surface of the earth, are lighted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
tiny electric lights. More than fifteen thousand men find
employment in this weird city. Day after day the brave
miners go down into the mines, never sure that they will
see the sunlight again, for many are the perils of mining.
Who has not read of the terrible disasters caused by
suffocation from fire damp, by flood, the falling of walls,
or the explosion of coal dust? Small particles of coal dust
are constantly floating in the mines, and much is stirred
up by the cars used to carry the coal to the outside world.
A tiny spark may ignite this dust and cause it to explode
with terrific force. Sometimes even the presence of much
oxygen in the air will make the dust explode, tearing down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a><br /><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
great blocks of coal which bury the poor miners or stop
up the passageways so that there is no escape unless the
victims are dug out before they die.</p>

<p>But the world must have coal, for, used for our great
boilers, it drives our powerful locomotives, sends mighty
vessels plowing across the ocean, and supplies the power
which turns the wheels of industry, both great and small.
Yes, the world must have coal. So Uncle Sam, in pity for
the miners who brave these awful dangers, has bought a
mine at Bruceton, a short distance from Pittsburgh. There
the government is making experiments to find out the
causes of explosion, aiming in this way to protect the
miners by lessening their dangers.</p>

</div>

<p>A little more than fifty
years ago petroleum, or
rock oil, was discovered
near Pittsburgh, and although
oil has since been
found in many other
places, Pittsburgh is still
one of the great centers
for this product. Crude
petroleum as it comes
from the earth is a liquid,
formed from the decay of
plants and animals long
ago buried underground.
It is obtained by sinking
wells, or pipes, into oil-bearing
rock, which is
very porous. Sometimes
the pipes are sunk a quarter
of a mile deep. The
average yield is from 50
to 75 barrels a day, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
occasionally a pipe well is found which yields as high
as 1000 barrels.</p>

<p>Sometimes a well stops flowing. Then the oil must be
pumped from the earth or else forced out by the explosion
of dynamite. Such a well is spoken of as a &ldquo;shot well.&rdquo;
When a well is shot, a vast column of oil is thrown into
the air, just as water is thrown up in a geyser or hot
spring, by the action of gases under ground.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh makes great storage tanks for the oil, as
well as apparatus for drilling wells, and supplies these
not only to our own country but to every foreign land
in which oil is found.</p>

<p>When petroleum is heated it gives off vapors, varying
according to the heat. These vapors are then condensed and
form many products which are now in every-day use, such
as kerosene, gasoline, naphtha, and benzine. Vaseline is
what remains in the vats after heating the petroleum.
Paraffin is another product. Pittsburgh manufactures all
these and supplies them to the world.</p>

<p>The discovery of natural gas about twenty-five years
ago, and its use as a fuel, attracted the attention of the
world to Pittsburgh as a center of cheap fuel. Natural
gas is found in and around oil fields, so it is supposed
that the gas and the oil have the same origin. The porous
rock in which the gas is found is usually covered with
clay rock, or shale, which prevents the gas from escaping.
Natural gas, like petroleum, is obtained by sinking pipes.
When the gas is reached, it rushes out with great force.
Large quantities of it were formerly used in Pittsburgh's
glass factories and iron works, but its greatest use to-day
is for lighting and heating.</p>

<p>In one section of the city there is a distinct German

newspapers. Another
section has received
the name of Little
Italy because of the
number of Italians
who have come

<p>Pittsburgh can
boast of many great
men. It is the home
of Andrew Carnegie,
whose reputation for
wealth and benevolence
is world wide.
He it was who conceived
the idea of
founding free libraries
in different
cities, they in turn
to support these
libraries by giving
an annual sum for
that purpose. His
first offer was to
his own city. In 1881 he proposed to give Pittsburgh
$250,000 for a free public library if the city would set
apart $15,000 each year for its care. The offer was refused,
and the library was given to Allegheny instead.
Later Mr. Carnegie gave Pittsburgh an Institute and
Library combined, for the support of which the city gives
$200,000 each year. The Carnegie Institute is a massive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and beautiful building in Schenley Park. It covers 5 acres
of land and is filled with treasures of art and literature.
To-day there are nine Carnegie libraries in Pittsburgh,
containing over 360,000 volumes.</p>

<p>George Westinghouse was another Pittsburgh capitalist.
His early days were spent in making agricultural implements
in Schenectady.
He was called
Lazy George because
he was always
making pieces of
machinery to save
doing work with his
hands. Later, by
his invention of air
brakes for trains, he
became rich. Choosing
Pittsburgh as
his home, he established
in and near
the city the great
Westinghouse Electric
Company. It
was Mr. Westinghouse
who gave to

<h2><a name="DETROIT" id="DETROIT">DETROIT</a></h2>

<p>In population, Detroit is the ninth city of the United
States.</p>

<p>In the value of its manufactured products, it is fifth.</p>

<p>In the value of its exports, it is the leading port on
the Canadian border.</p>

<p>With these facts in mind it will be interesting to learn
something of the history of Detroit; something of the
goods it manufactures and the reasons for its growth and
prosperity.</p>

<p>During the years when the French governed Canada,
manufacturing and agriculture played a very small part
in their affairs. Their business men were chiefly interested
in the fur trade; their governors were interested
mainly in extending the territory over which floated the
banner of their king; and the teaching of Christianity to
the hordes of Indians who inhabited the country seemed of
the greatest importance to their priests and missionaries.</p>

<p>So, because it served the purpose of each, all three
classes&mdash;the fur traders, the crown officers, and the missionaries&mdash;worked
hand in hand in exploring and in penetrating
the wilderness in every direction. They suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
every hardship, endured every privation, and very often
fell victims to the cruelty of the savages.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

        <a name="img_190" id="img_190"></a>
<p class="caption">THE GREAT LAKES</p>
</div>

<p>In those days of French rule, railroads were unheard
of, and wagon roads were almost as scarce. Travel was
sometimes through the woods, along the trails made by
the Indians; but usually it was by the water courses,
over which the Indian canoes carried furs to be traded
for the goods of the French.</p>

<p>Now if you will look at a map which shows the Canadian
border of the United States and follow the course
of the Great Lakes, you will see that at four places their
broad waters narrow into rivers or straits. These places
are first, the Niagara River; second, where the waters
of Lake Huron pass into Lake Erie; third, at the Sault
Ste. Marie; and fourth, at the Straits of Mackinac.</p>

<p>Between the East and the West, the Great Lakes and
the St. Lawrence River formed the main artery of travel.
To control the narrow rivers and straits that connect the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Great Lakes was to control the travel over them, and
as the French extended their rule from Quebec to the
West, they fortified these narrow places one by one.</p>

<p>Fort Niagara was built at the mouth of the Niagara
River. Then on July 24, 1701, Antoine de la Mothe
Cadillac landed on the banks of the Detroit River and
began the work of building a palisade fort, almost where
the river widens into Lake Saint Clair.</p>

<p>Cadillac thought that at Fort Detroit he had found one
of the garden spots of the country. In the pine forests
of the Michigan peninsula game of every sort abounded,
and their skins enriched alike the Indians and the French.
The waters of Lake Saint Clair swarmed with wild fowl.
In the woods wild grapes grew in profusion, and the rich
lands bordering both sides of the river assured plentiful
crops, depending only upon the industry of those who
tilled the soil. However, in spite of his enthusiasm over
the beauty of the site, Cadillac proceeded to lay out a
very ugly little town with rude dwellings huddled along
narrow muddy streets.</p>

<p>Such as it was, Detroit remained under French rule
for fifty-nine years, becoming one of the most prosperous
of the French outposts. The Indians were, for the most
part, friendly with the French, and in 1760 the place had
a population of 2500, which made it of great importance
in the sparsely settled West.</p>

<p>Then came the years of the French and Indian wars,
and finally the French, having lost Quebec, were obliged
to surrender to the English. So in November, 1760, Detroit
was given up to Major Robert Rogers in command
of a detachment of British regulars and American militia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>The English were not allowed to remain long in undisturbed
possession of their new outpost. Pontiac, chief of
the Ottawas and one of the craftiest of all Indian warriors,
was friendly to the French. In 1763, through his
immense influence with all the Western tribes, he organized
a conspiracy to drive the English from the territory which
they had won with such difficulty. Detroit was one of
the first places to be attacked. The siege lasted several
months, but in spite of the cruelty and cunning of the
attack, the garrison held out until at last relief came.
Thus by their bravery they did much to prevent the success
of Pontiac's Conspiracy, as the uprising is called.</p>

<p>Then came the Revolution. At its close, the Treaty of
Paris was signed in 1783. By the terms of this treaty,
Detroit, together with the other British outposts in the
West, became the property of the United States. However,
it was not until 1796 that the place was actually
occupied by American troops.</p>

<p>Sixteen years later Detroit again passed into the possession
of the British. This was during the war of 1812
and followed the defeat of General William Hull's ill-fated
expedition into Canada. Falling back to Detroit,
Hull was attacked, and surrendered to the British after
a half-hearted resistance.</p>

<p>A little more than a year later, however, in October,
1813, Oliver Hazard Perry won the famous battle of
Lake Erie. This gave the Americans control of the lake,
and the British soon abandoned Detroit, which has since
remained in the possession of the United States.</p>

<p>Detroit had prospered but little since 1760. Its inhabitants
were for the most part easy-going Frenchmen. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
were not suited to the strenuous work of city building.
Detroit, instead of growing larger, was becoming smaller;
and when, in 1820, the United States took a census of the
place, it had but 1442 inhabitants as against the 2500
that Major Rogers found in 1760.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">DETROIT IN 1820, AND STEAMER <i>WALK-IN-THE-WATER</i><br />(From an old print)</p>
</div>

<p>But from 1820 the growth of Detroit has been continuous.
In 1825 the Erie Canal was opened, furnishing
an easy means of communication from the East to the
West. Then came a great tide of immigration to all the
states bordering on the Great Lakes. Michigan was one of
the first to profit, and Detroit was the gateway to Michigan.</p>

<p>Most of the pioneers who sought homes in the West
were farmers. The life of cities and villages offered few
attractions to them. The number that stayed in Detroit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
was small as compared to the number that passed through
into the back country to clear the woodlands and take
up the work of agriculture.</p>

<p>But as the back country filled up, there came a demand
for the things in which cities deal, while at the same time
there came the need of places where the products of the
farm could be gathered together ready for transportation
to the Eastern market.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

        alt="see caption"
        title="see caption" />
<p class="caption">A DRY DOCK</p>
</div>

<p>In this way Detroit began its great growth. It bought
the wool and wheat which the Michigan farmers raised,
and shipped them East. It bought from the East the dry
goods, hardware, and various other things which the
Michigan farmers needed, and distributed them. It grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
prosperous as the country back of it became more populated,
and as this population became richer and able to
buy larger amounts and more expensive goods, Detroit
reaped the advantage.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

        alt="see caption"
        title="see caption" />
<p class="caption">A PASSENGER STEAMER</p>
</div>

<p>Then too the traffic on the lakes became more important,
requiring larger and better vessels. Detroit has one
of the best harbors on all the Great Lakes, making it
splendidly suited for the building and launching of vessels.
Always engaged more or less in shipbuilding, Detroit
improved its shipyards and kept pace with the demand.
To-day it builds all types of vessels, from magnificent
passenger steamers to the great steel ore ships which
carry the iron ore of the Lake Superior districts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in 1860 that Detroit began to take its place
among the industrial cities of the country. Now it is
fifth among the cities of the United States in the value
of its manufactured products. Let us see what its chief
industries are.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

        alt="see caption"
        title="see caption" />
<p class="caption">A LAKE VESSEL BUILT IN DETROIT</p>
</div>

<p>First of all comes the manufacture of automobiles and
the parts of which they are made. It is estimated that
more than half of all the automobiles made in the United
States are built in Detroit factories. Until 1899 there
was not a single automobile factory in the city. To-day
there are over thirty, many of them covering acres of
ground.</p>

<p>As few of the automobile factories make all the parts
of their machines, there are in Detroit many shops for
the manufacture of steel, aluminium, and brass castings,
and of gears, wheels, and various other automobile parts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>Another of Detroit's important industries is the manufacture
and repair of steam- and electric-railroad cars.
These are largely freight cars, although many passenger
cars are also made.</p>

<p>Other lines of business include foundry and machine-shop
products, the making of druggists' preparations, the
manufacture of flour, the packing of beef and pork, and
the preparation of other food stuffs.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

        alt="see caption"
        title="see caption" />
<p class="caption">WHERE AUTOMOBILES ARE MADE</p>
</div>

<p>Then Detroit makes great quantities of soda ash and
alkalies. This industry Detroit owes to the fact that here
are found both limestone and salt, which is obtained from
wells driven along the river bank. Both of these materials
are required in the manufacture of soda ash.</p>

<p>The printing-and-publishing business gives employment
to thousands; so does the manufacture of paints and varnishes.
In stoves, ranges, and furnaces, Detroit leads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
every other city in the country. It is interesting to know
that Detroit makes great numbers of adding machines,
that it is the largest producer of overalls in the country,
that it is a center of the brass industry, that it turns out
more than 300,000,000 cigars each year, and that it is
one of the largest producers of wrought- and malleable-iron
castings.</p>

<p>The entire business of a city is, of course, never wholly
manufacturing. Part of its business is always the distribution
of things to supply the needs of its inhabitants
and of the people who live in the surrounding country.</p>

<p>When these goods are sold in large quantities to merchants
who in turn sell them to the person using them,
the business is known as a wholesale business. When
they are sold by the merchant directly to the user, he does
what is called a retail business.</p>

<p>The wholesale business of Detroit is very large. Its
merchants do the larger part of the wholesale business
through the entire state of Michigan and in parts of
northern Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.
They even furnish certain supplies to some parts of
Canada. Dry goods, drugs, hardware, and groceries are
the principal things in which Detroit wholesalers deal.</p>

<p>Detroit has also many large retail stores, which supply
not only the people who live in the city of Detroit but
those in the surrounding country as well. Thanks to the
many suburban electric railroads and the many steam
roads, the people who live in the smaller places are able
to come to Detroit to purchase things they want.</p>

<p>Now let us take our map again and notice the location
of Detroit in relation to the rest of the country, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
location, as you know, has very much to do with the
growth of cities.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

        alt="see caption"
        title="see caption" />
<p class="caption">THE DETROIT RIVER TUNNEL</p>
</div>

<p>We find in the first place that it is separated from
Canada by only the width of a river. So we are not surprised
to hear that Detroit is one of the principal points
for the exchange of goods between the two countries.
The two most important Canadian railroads have terminals
at Windsor, on the Canadian side of the water, and
also at Detroit. A very large part of the United States
finds Detroit the most convenient point from which to
send its products into Canada, since goods can so easily
be brought to Detroit by water or rail.</p>

<p>Statistics issued by the United States government show
that of the eighteen customhouses on the Canadian border
the one at Detroit does the largest volume of business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Then too, by the lakes, Detroit can reach all of the
American lake ports, and from Buffalo, through the Erie
Canal, it can even reach New York.</p>

<p>The many railroads which serve Detroit give it excellent
communication with all parts of the United States.
The Michigan Central Railroad dives under the river, from
Detroit to Windsor, through one of the most remarkable
tunnels in the world. For years the cars of the Michigan
Central Railroad, both passenger and freight, were carried
across the river on ferryboats. This, of course, was a very
slow way of crossing, but a bridge was impractical for
various reasons, so at last it was decided to build
a tunnel.</p>

<p>When the engineers studied the river bottom, they
found that it was covered with mud so deep that it was
impossible to build a tunnel under it. Instead they built
the tunnel of steel on the river bank, and when it was
completed they sank it in sections and then fastened
it together.</p>

<p>Two belt-line railroads, extending from the river bank,
circle through Detroit. One is some two miles from the
center, the other, six. Along these railroads are many
factories which have switches directly into their plants.
This makes shipping a simple matter for the Detroit
manufacturers.</p>

<p>Now, having learned something of the history of Detroit,
something of the manufacturing which it does and the
commerce it carries on, let us take a look at the city itself.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">THE CITY OF DETROIT</p>
</div>

<p>The older parts of most great cities are badly laid out.
In very few cases do men realize that their little settlements
are to grow into large cities. And so they pay little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a><br /><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
attention to laying out streets, but in building their
houses follow the farm lanes and often the paths made
by the cows as they are driven to and from the pastures.</p>

<p>This is not always the case however. Washington was
laid out long before it ever became a city, and, in consequence,
it has magnificent broad streets and many parks.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/img_202.jpg" width="600" height="360"
        alt="see caption"
        title="see caption" />
<p class="caption">NORTH WOODWARD AVENUE</p>
</div>

<p>Detroit was one of the badly laid-out settlements, but
in 1805 a fire burned every house in Detroit with one
exception. Now at that time Judge Augustus B. Woodward
was a prominent figure in the city government.
When the fire wiped out the old town, the judge thought
that a plan should be made for Detroit just as had been
done for Washington. His idea was to have a great
circle, called the Grand Circus, in the center of the
town. Two streets, 120 feet wide, were to cross this
circle, dividing it into quarters, and from the circle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
other broad avenues were to radiate in all directions.
As the city grew, other circles were to be built with
streets radiating from them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the citizens of Detroit did not have the
belief in the growth of their city that Judge Woodward
had, and so his scheme was only carried out in part. That
part, however, gave to Detroit its Grand Circus, its broad
avenues, and its down-town parks, and did much to earn
for it the title of the City Beautiful.</p>

<p>Detroit to-day has many splendid and costly residences.
It has also street after street filled with comfortable
medium-priced houses where the workmen live, and its
people are fond of boasting that it is a city of homes.</p>

<p>Woodward Avenue, which is 120 feet wide, is named
after Judge Woodward. This avenue runs from the river
bank right through the entire city. At its lower end it is
the principal retail street of the city, while further out are
many fine residences.</p>

<p>As the town grew, a boulevard was built, which, starting
at the river, runs completely around the city at a distance
of some two and a half miles from the center.
This boulevard is known as the Grand Boulevard and is
more than 12 miles long and from 150 to 200 feet in
width. In the center is a narrow strip upon which are
grown flowers, trees, and grass, while upon either side
run macadam roads.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">AT BELLE ISLE</p>
</div>

<p>The most popular of Detroit's parks is Belle Isle. This
is on an island of about 700 acres, directly opposite the
city. Originally the island was for the most part a swamp
infested with snakes. In order to get rid of the snakes
a drove of hogs was turned loose on the island, and for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
long time it was known as Hog Island. Then the city
bought it and turned it into a park. The swamps were
drained, and lakes and canals were built, which in the
summer time are covered with canoes and boats. In the
winter they make excellent places for skating. Playgrounds,
baseball fields, and picnic grounds were laid out
and a zoo was built, as well as one of the best aquariums
in the country. And here, too, is a horticultural building,
where many rare plants and flowers are grown. A large
part of the island was covered with woods, and this was
left in its native state, with winding roads built through
it. The island is connected with the mainland by a
broad bridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>The health conditions of Detroit are excellent. Its
water supply is taken at a depth of 40 feet from the
Detroit River, just where it leaves Lake Saint Clair. The
city has an ample sewerage system. It has many fine
public schools, and here also are the University of Detroit
and the Detroit colleges of law and medicine. In short,
from every point of view Detroit is a good place in which
to live.</p>

<p>A short time ago prizes were offered to the public-school
pupils in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grades for
the five best essays on &ldquo;Why I am Glad I live in
Detroit.&rdquo; Here is what one sixth-grade boy wrote about
his home city:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a beautiful city is Detroit,&rdquo; says the world-wide
traveler, as he passes along its broad avenues, in the shade of
its magnificent trees. &ldquo;Detroit has a fine commercial center,&rdquo;
says the enterprising manufacturer as he surveys its busy
wharves. &ldquo;What an excellent situation this city has,&rdquo; says
the farmer, as he comes trudging to town with his load of
produce. &ldquo;In Detroit life is worth living,&rdquo; says the happy
pleasure seeker, as he whiles away his time, either on the lake
or in its many parks and boulevards. &ldquo;You can have loads of
fun at Belle Isle,&rdquo; whispers the small boy, as he thinks of the
many pastimes which so appeal to every child. &ldquo;What an interesting
history has Detroit,&rdquo; says the historian, as he recalls
its many struggles, first with the Indians, then with the
French, and last of all the English.</p>

<p>Many strangers will come to our city during the next
few months, and I know that after they have seen it and
go to their homes again, they will tell their neighbors and
friends of our beautiful city, and I, who live here, will be
very proud of it.</p>

<h2><a name="BUFFALO" id="BUFFALO">BUFFALO</a></h2>

<p>About 1783 Cornelius Winne, a trader, built a little
log store at the mouth of Buffalo River, which empties
into Lake Erie. That was the beginning of Buffalo, the
queen city of the lakes, the home to-day of more than
four hundred thousand people.</p>

<p>To understand the wonderful growth of this city we
must go back to the days of the Revolution and see New
York in those early times. Almost all the people of the
United States then lived on the narrow strip of land
lying between the Atlantic Ocean and the Appalachian
Highlands. The high forest-covered mountains made a
barrier that kept the colonial settlers from attempting to
push out toward the west.</p>

<p>But in New York State nature had left an opening
between the mountain ranges, along the courses of the
Hudson and the Mohawk rivers. Settlers had early
followed these streams and built homes in their valleys.
Beyond lay the trackless hunting grounds of the Indians&mdash;the
great West.</p>

<p>With the close of the Revolution things began to
change. New York made a treaty with the Indians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
whereby they agreed to sell large tracts of their lands.
Pioneers pushed their way into the unknown wilderness
of the western part of the state and found a beautiful
fertile country. Their reports led hundreds to follow
them. Soon central and northern New York were dotted
with settlements. More and more immigrants kept coming,
all seeking the land beyond the Appalachian Mountains.
The great western movement of the nineteenth century
had begun.</p>

</div>

<p>Winne had built his trading post before this westward
movement reached Lake Erie. For some time he lived in
his log cabin in the midst of the forest, with no neighbors
except the Indians with whom he traded. But gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
other settlers came and built homes near him. By 1804
there were about twenty houses in the little settlement,
which, for a short time, was called New Amsterdam.</p>

NEW YORK'S CANALS</p>
</div>

<p>By 1812 the name had been changed to Buffalo, and
the town had a population of 1500. That year war with
England broke out, and in 1813 a body of British soldiers
with their Indian allies crossed the Niagara River during
the night, took the Americans by surprise, and burned
Buffalo. Of its three hundred houses, just one escaped the
flames. But nothing daunted, the men began to rebuild
their homes, and in a few years no traces of the fire
were to be seen.</p>

<p>In early times the Indians going from the seacoast to
the Great Lakes had followed the Hudson and Mohawk
rivers and then gone on directly west to Lake Erie.
With the coming of the white man the Indian pathway
grew into a road, and in 1811 stagecoaches began to
run over this road between Buffalo and Albany.</p>

<p>But carrying passengers and freight by stagecoach
was very expensive, and a few men, headed by Governor
De Witt Clinton, began to say that the state ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
build a canal connecting Lake Erie with the Hudson
River. Many laughed at this idea. They knew very little
about canals and thought it foolish to waste millions of
dollars on a useless &ldquo;big ditch,&rdquo; as they called it.</p>

<div class="figleft">

        alt="see caption"
        title="see caption" />
<p class="caption">TRAVELING BY CANAL</p>
</div>

<p>However, those in favor of the scheme finally won, and
the work of building the Erie Canal was begun in 1817.
It very nearly followed the old trail between Albany and
Buffalo and was 363
miles long. Eighty-three
locks raised and
lowered the boats
where there was a
difference of level
in the canal. Lockport,
a city 25 miles
northeast of Buffalo,
was named after
these locks, there being
10 of them there.</p>

<p>In 1825 the work
was completed; the
Erie Canal was opened, and at last there was a waterway
between the Great Lakes and the Atlantic. All the
towns along the canal held a great celebration. None had
better reason for rejoicing than Buffalo. In 1825 Buffalo
was a little hamlet on the frontier. Thanks to the Erie
Canal, it was soon to become one of the leading cities of
the country.</p>

<p>It was not long before the &ldquo;big ditch&rdquo; was known as
the &ldquo;path to the great West.&rdquo; A rush of emigration
further west followed, and all these travelers stopped at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Buffalo, for here they had to change from the flat-bottomed
canal boats to the lake vessels. Hotels were crowded,
business flourished, and Buffalo became &ldquo;a great doorway
of the inland sea.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">THE BARGE CANAL NEAR BUFFALO</p>
</div>

<p>During the first years after its completion little freight
was carried over the Erie Canal, but settlers kept flocking
into the West, and before many years these Western
pioneers were raising far more grain than they could use.
Lake commerce began. Hundreds of ships brought wheat,
lumber, and furs to Buffalo from the West and returned
laden with manufactured goods. Buffalo was the chief
lake port, and for many years shipping was its leading
industry.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p class="caption">THE SITE OF BUFFALO</p>
</div>

<p>Then came the railroads. The first railroad to Buffalo
was completed in 1836. A few years later, trains ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
between Albany and Buffalo, and in time carloads of
grain were shipped by rail. Though shipments by canal
continued and even increased for a time, the railroads
gradually did more and more of the carrying, and finally
robbed the canal of much of its former importance.</p>

<p>Still, shipping by
canal was cheaper.
Improvements have
been made in the
Erie Canal from
time to time, and
in 1903 the state
voted $101,000,000
for the enlargement
of the Erie,
Oswego, and Champlain
canals into
the 1000-ton-barge
canal. When this
is completed it will
be 12 feet deep and
will float much
larger barges than
did the Erie Canal.</p>

<p>But to return to Buffalo. The city's location naturally made it one of the
great centers of the country. Only the Niagara River
separates the city from the most thickly settled part of
Canada, and it is therefore a most convenient meeting
place of the two countries. Already Buffalo's trade with
Canada amounts to over $50,000,000 a year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides being one of the chief commercial centers of
the country, Buffalo is an important manufacturing town.
Three things are necessary to success in manufacturing&mdash;raw
materials, power, and a market where the finished
goods can be sold. Buffalo has all of these near at
hand. The country round about is singularly rich in
natural resources. Forests, fertile farm lands, and rich
iron and coal deposits are all within easy reach of the
city and supply it with raw material at small cost for
transportation.</p>

<p>No city in the world has greater advantages than
Buffalo in the matter of power. The Niagara Falls
furnish an unlimited supply of electric power, which is
a substitute for coal and, for many purposes, more convenient.
Buffalo's nearness to the coal fields of Pennsylvania
makes the cost of both hard and soft coal low.
Natural gas and oil furnish about one fifth of the power
now used in the city. Both are found near Buffalo, stored
in the pores and cavities of rocks. Holes are bored into
the rocks, and the petroleum or rock oil is pumped into
huge tanks. The gas is carried by underground pipes
to the city, where it is used in heating and lighting
thousands of homes and factories.</p>

<p>Lastly, Buffalo does not have to ship its products far
to find a market. Within 450 miles of the city live
almost 50,000,000 people, and lakes, canals, and railroads
offer cheap and rapid transportation to all parts of the
country. Thirteen steamship lines and 18 railroads enter
the city. There are 2 trunk lines from New England;
5 from New York; 1 from Philadelphia, Baltimore, and
Washington; 1 from St. Louis; and 4 from Chicago.</p>

<p class="caption">LACKAWANNA IRON AND STEEL COMPANY</p>
</div>

<p>The richest
iron mines in
the world are
located south of
Lake Superior,
but there are no
coal deposits in
this region, and
coal is necessary
for the manufacturing
of iron
and steel. As it
was cheaper to
ship the ore to
the coal than
to carry the coal
to the ore, there
were men who,
as early as 1860,
saw that iron
and steel could
be manufactured
with profit in
Buffalo. Though
blast furnaces
were built from
time to time, the
industry did not
attract great
attention until
1899. In that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
year the Lackawanna Iron and Steel Company, of Scranton,
Pennsylvania, moved to Buffalo and built an immense
metal-working plant. This plant is south of the
city and extends several miles along the shore of Lake
Erie. The company has built a ship canal over half
a mile long, which the largest lake vessels can enter.
On one side of this canal are hundreds of coke ovens
and the storage grounds for coal; on the other side are
the ore docks, a row of huge blast furnaces, and the
steel works with their numerous mills, foundries, and
workshops.</p>

<p>In the coke ovens millions of tons of soft coal are every
year turned into coke, which is really coal with certain
things removed by heating. This coke is used in melting
the iron in the blast furnaces&mdash;so called because during
the melting strong blasts of air are forced into the furnaces.
These furnaces are almost a hundred feet high,
are made of iron, and lined with fire brick. Tons of
coke, limestone, and iron ore are dropped in from above
by machinery, and the intense heat of the burning coke
melts the iron, which sinks to the bottom of the furnace
while the limestone collects the impurities and forms an
upper layer. At the bottom of the furnace there are openings
where the fiery-hot liquid runs off into molds, or
forms, in which it cools and hardens. The waste matter,
called slag, is also drawn off at the bottom. More coke
and ore are added from above, and the smelting goes on
night and day without interruption until the furnace
needs repair. After the iron has been separated from the
ore, it is taken to the foundries where it is made into
steel rails and many other kinds of iron and steel goods.</p>

<p>Back in the first half of the nineteenth century New
York was the leading
wheat-raising
and flour-producing
state. The first flour
mill in the Buffalo
district was run by
water power furnished
by the Erie
Canal. As larger
mills followed and
steam took the place
of water power,
Buffalo became an
important flour-milling
center. Later,
wheat began to be
raised further west,
and the Central
States soon took the
lead in wheat growing
and flour milling. But Buffalo had the advantage of
an early start. Its mills were already built and working.
Grain from the West kept pouring into the city to be
stored in its great grain elevators, and the production of
flour increased. Larger mills were built, some of them making
use of the Niagara water power. To-day there are more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
than a dozen companies in Buffalo operating flour mills
which turn out over 3,000,000 barrels of flour in a year.</p>

<p>Buffalo's slaughter-house products for a single year are
worth millions of dollars. There are two large meat-packing
firms in the city, slaughtering over a million
cattle and hogs each
year. They both had
small beginnings in
the butcher business
more than fifty years
ago. In 1852 the
first stockyards were
opened, and the city's
live-stock industry
began. Shipments of
live stock from the
grazing states of the
West increased until
the city became
the second cattle
market in the world,
Chicago alone handling
more live stock
than Buffalo.</p>

<p>When first settled, the lake region was covered with
forests, and lumber was one of the first products sent
eastward by lake steamers. Millions and millions of feet
of pine were towed down the lakes on barges and transferred
to canal boats at Buffalo, and the city became one
of the great lumber markets of the country. Although
shipments from the Northern forests have not been so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a><br /><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
great in the last twenty years, the lumber industry continues
to be of great importance to Buffalo. In addition
to pine from the lake region, the city receives hard wood
from the South. You see enormous piles of lumber in the
yards of the city itself, and Tonawanda, a suburb ten
miles north of Buffalo, has the largest lumber yards in
the world. These yards carry on a large wholesale and
retail trade, and sawmills, planing mills, and many lumber
industries have grown up around them. Mill work,
doors, mantels, piano cases, and furniture are some of the
things made in the Buffalo workshops.</p>

<p>While commerce and industry were thus developing,
the city itself was growing in size, population, and beauty.
It extends about ten miles along the shore of Lake Erie
and the Niagara River. In the residence section there are
thousands of beautiful homes, set well back from broad
streets and surrounded by wide lawns and gardens.
Delaware Avenue, with its branching boulevards and
parkways, is the finest of these residence sections.</p>

<p>Through the southern part of the city flows the sluggish
and winding Buffalo River. In the early days the mouth
of this stream was the only harbor of the port, although
it was then very shallow. Millions of dollars have been
spent in deepening and improving this inner harbor, while
a larger outer harbor has been made by inclosing a part
of the lake by breakwaters. The harbor of Buffalo is now
one of the best on the Great Lakes.</p>

<p>About two miles north of the mouth of Buffalo River
is The Front, a park overlooking the water and giving
a beautiful view of Lake Erie, the Niagara River, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>

<p>In the center of Niagara Square stands the McKinley
Monument, erected by the state of New York in honor of
President William McKinley, who was shot at the Pan-American
Exposition in Buffalo, on September 6, 1901.
It was in this city that President Roosevelt took the oath
of office after President McKinley's death. It is also
worthy of note that Buffalo was the home of two of our
presidents&mdash;Fillmore and Cleveland.</p>

<p>The business district of Buffalo is only a short distance
from the harbor. The most important business streets are
Main Street and Broadway.</p>

<p>Twenty miles north of Buffalo the Niagara River
plunges over a precipice more than one hundred and fifty
feet high, forming the world-famous Niagara Falls. The
width of the river, the beauty of the mighty waters as
they rush thundering over the edge of the precipice, the
foam and spray rising from the foot of the cataract, all
combine to make Niagara Falls the greatest natural wonder
on the American continent. In the middle of the
stream lies Goat Island, which divides the Falls into the
Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side and the American
Falls on the New York side.</p>

<p>Hardly less interesting than the Falls are the power
plants on both sides of the river, which are making the
force of Niagara do a mighty work. It has been reckoned
that the volume of water which passes over the Falls
is two hundred and sixty-five thousand cubic feet each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
second. Think of it! This tremendous rush of water, the
experts tell us, represents five million horse power. To
make this gigantic power of use to man, canals have been
built above the Falls to bring water from the river to
the power houses where its great force turns huge water
wheels and produces electric power. Cables of copper
wire raised high in the air carry this power to all the
surrounding country. It runs many of Buffalo's factories,
lights the city streets, and moves its trolley cars as well
as those in Syracuse, one hundred and fifty miles away.</p>

<p>Such then, with its wonderful power, its command of
material, its beautiful and important location, is the
Buffalo of to-day. The little settlement of one hundred
years ago has become the eleventh city in size in the
United States.</p>

the development of the resources of California. In 1769
Spain sent an expedition overland from Mexico to colonize
the Pacific coast, and Don Gaspar de Portolá, at the
head of these colonists, was the first white man known
to have looked upon San Francisco Bay.</p>

<p>Seven years later, in 1776, the Franciscan friars built
a fortified settlement on the present site of San Francisco.
The Mission Dolores, which is still standing, was
begun the same year, and a little village slowly grew
up around it.</p>

<p>At the close of the Mexican War, in 1848, California
was ceded to the United States, and the Stars and Stripes
were raised over the little settlement, whose name was
soon changed from Yerba Buena to San Francisco.</p>

<p>In 1848, too, came the discovery of gold in California,
and San Francisco suddenly grew from a Spanish village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
to a busy American town. The population jumped from
800 to 10,000 in a single year. A city of tents and
shanties quickly arose on the sand dunes. Thousands of
people were leaving their homes in the East to seek a
fortune in the gold fields. Many came by water, either
rounding Cape Horn or else traveling by boat to the
Isthmus of Panama, crossing on foot, and reëmbarking
on the Pacific coast. Others came overland in large
canvas-covered wagons called prairie schooners.</p>

<p>These newcomers were men of all classes&mdash;ministers,
lawyers, farmers, laborers. Some were educated, others
were ignorant. While most of them were industrious and
law-abiding, a considerable number were desperate and
lawless men. These last caused much trouble. Gambling,
murders, and crimes of all kinds were alarmingly common,
and the city government was powerless to punish the
lawbreakers. Finally, the better class of citizens formed
a vigilance committee, which hung four criminals and
punished many in other ways until law and order were
established.</p>

<p>San Francisco has been called the &ldquo;child of the mines.&rdquo;
It was the discovery of gold that first made it the leading
city of the Pacific coast. From that day the production of
gold has been steadily maintained. Nearly $20,000,000
worth is mined in the state of California each year, with
a total production of over $1,500,000,000. Later the silver
mines in Nevada were discovered and developed, and their
immense output brought increased wealth to San Francisco.</p>

<p>As time went on, however, people began to see that
California's real wealth lay not so much in her mines
as in her fertile farm lands. These, combined with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
wonderful climate, have made California a leading agricultural
state.</p>

<p class="caption">AN ORANGE GROVE</p>
</div>

<p>The great central valley of California, about 400 miles
long and 50 miles wide, lies between the Sierra Nevada
Mountains and the Coast Ranges. Its farms, orchards,
orange groves, and vineyards produce immense quantities
of grain, and of grapes, and other fruits. Large numbers
of cattle and sheep are raised. In the southern counties
many tropical fruits are grown successfully. Irrigated
groves of orange, lemon, and olive trees cover thousands
of acres. Other important crops are English walnuts,
almonds, prunes, and figs. Copper, silver, oil, quicksilver,
and salt are also valuable products, while the forest-covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
mountains supply excellent lumber. Such is the wealth of
California's natural resources, and San Francisco is the
great port and market of this rich back country.</p>

<p>As the Sacramento River flows into San Francisco Bay
from the north and the San Joaquin from the south, the
two offer cheap transportation up and down their valleys,
being navigable to river steamers for over 200 miles.</p>

<p>The great bay of San Francisco is the largest landlocked
harbor in the world. Here the navies of all the
nations could ride at anchor side by side in safety.
Though 65 miles long and from 4 to 10 miles wide, the
bay is completely sheltered from dangerous winds and
storms. It is connected with the Pacific Ocean by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
strait called the Golden Gate, which is 2&frac34; miles long
and over a mile wide.</p>

<p class="caption">THE GOLDEN GATE</p>

<p>Such advantages have made San Francisco a great
commercial and financial center. Ships from San Francisco
carry the products of California westward to all the
countries bordering on the Pacific, while others sail to
the Atlantic seaports of America and Europe.</p>

<p>The outgoing steamers are loaded with wheat, cotton,
canned goods, oil, barley, prunes, flour, dried fruits,
leather, machinery, lumber, and iron manufactures. Incoming
steamers bring raw silk, coffee, tea, copra, nitrate
of soda, tin ingots, sugar, rice, cigars, coal, burlap, vanilla
beans, cheese, and manila hemp.</p>

<p>Already the foreign commerce of San Francisco amounts
to more than $150,000,000 annually, and with the increasing
trade of Japan and China and the shortened route to
the Atlantic through the Panama Canal, the future of its
foreign trade cannot be estimated.</p>

<p>In addition to her foreign trade, San Francisco has
many growing industries at home. Printing and publishing,
slaughtering and meat packing, are among the most
important. The
canning and preserving
of fruits
and vegetables is
a leading industry
of the city. The
California Fruit
Canners Association
employs many
thousands of people
during the fruit
season and is the
largest fruit-and-vegetable
canning company in the world. It operates thirty
branches throughout the state, and its products are sent to
all parts of the globe.</p>

<p>Though iron has to be imported,&mdash;there being little
mined in California,&mdash;the city does a thriving iron business.
In the early days there was need of mining
machinery in the West, and San Francisco at that time
began manufacturing it. She also has one of the greatest
shipbuilding plants in the United States. The famous
battleship <i>Oregon</i>, the <i>Olympic</i>, the <i>Wisconsin</i>, the <i>Ohio</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a><br /><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>

</div>

<p>In 1906 a severe earthquake shook San Francisco,
wrecking many buildings. Fire broke out in twenty
places, and as the earthquake had broken the city's water
mains, the fire fighters had to pump salt water from the
bay and use dynamite to stop the progress of the flames.
During the three days of the fire, four square miles were
laid in ruins.</p>

<p>Because of occasional slight shocks in former years, the
inhabitants had built their city of wood, thinking it safer
than brick or stone. They had not thought of the greater
danger of fire. This earthquake taught them a lesson.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
The few skyscrapers in the city had stood the shock remarkably
well, and profiting by this experience thousands
of modern structures&mdash;steel, brick, and reënforced concrete&mdash;were
built to replace the old wooden buildings.
A far more modern and beautiful city has arisen from
the ashes of the ruins.</p>

</div>

<p>The city occupies
46&frac12; square miles at
the end of the southern
peninsula which
lies between San Francisco
Bay and the
Pacific Ocean. The
site of the city is
hilly, especially in the
northern and western
parts. Market Street,
120 feet wide and
the chief business
thoroughfare, extends
southwest from the
water front and divides
the city into two
parts. The southern
district contains many manufacturing plants and the
homes of the laboring people. The streets here are level.
North of Market Street lie three high hills&mdash;Telegraph
Hill, Nob Hill, and Russian Hill. In this half of the city
are the finest residences, Nob Hill having been given its
name in the early days when the mining millionaires
built their homes upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>The main business section is in the northeastern part
of the city, facing the harbor, and is on level ground. It
contains hundreds of new office buildings, many of them
from eight to twenty or more stories high. Fine modern
hotels and beautiful banks add much to the beauty of this
part of San Francisco.
The most
important public
buildings are the
United States mint
and the post office,
which escaped the
flames in 1906, the
customhouse, the
Hall of Justice,
the new Auditorium,
and the city
hall. These last
two face the Civic
Center, which is
being created at
a cost of nearly
$17,000,000.</p>

<p>At the foot of
Telegraph Hill is
the largest Chinese quarter in the United States. It was
completely destroyed during the fire, but is now rebuilt
and much improved. Its temples, joss houses, and theaters,
its markets, bazaars, and restaurants, with their strange
life and customs and their oriental architecture, attract
crowds of visitors. There are now about 10,000 Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
in San Francisco, but their number has been steadily decreasing
since the Exclusion Act was passed, prohibiting
Chinese laborers from entering this country. It was
thought necessary to have this law in order to protect
the American workingman on the Pacific coast, as the
Chinese laborers who had already been admitted were
working for wages upon which no white man could live.</p>

<p>At the foot of Market Street, on the water front,
stands the Union Ferry Building, a large stone structure
with a high clock tower.</p>

<p>Only one of the cross-continent railroads&mdash;a branch of
the Southern Pacific&mdash;lands its passengers in the city of
San Francisco. All the other roads, which include the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
main line of the Southern Pacific, the Atchison, Topeka
&amp; Santa Fé, the Union Pacific, and the Western Pacific,
terminate on the eastern shore of the bay and send the
travelers to San Francisco by ferry. In consequence, San
Francisco has developed the best ferry service in the
world, all lines meeting at the Union Ferry Building.</p>

<p>North and south of the Union Ferry Building stretch
eight miles of wharves and docks and many factories,
lumber yards, and warehouses. At the docks, ships are
being loaded and unloaded continually.</p>

<p>In March and April each year a fleet of forty or fifty
vessels starts out for the Alaskan fisheries. San Francisco is
the leading salmon port of the United States, distributing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
millions of dollars' worth of salmon yearly. Fisherman's
Wharf, at the northern end of the water front, is full
of interest, with its brown, weather-beaten fishermen and
their odd fishing boats. To the south of the Union Ferry
Building is &ldquo;Man-of-war Row,&rdquo; where United States and
foreign battleships ride at anchor.</p>

<p>The cities of Alameda, Oakland, Richmond, and Berkeley
are directly across the bay from San Francisco, on the
east shore. Like New York, San Francisco is the center
of a large metropolitan district, and the residents of these
neighboring cities daily travel to their work in San Francisco
on the ferries. For several years there has been talk
of uniting these cities with San Francisco. If this plan were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>

<h2><a name="NEW_ORLEANS" id="NEW_ORLEANS">NEW ORLEANS</a></h2>

<p>The story of New Orleans, the Crescent City, reads like
a wonderful romance or a tale from the Arabian Nights.
As in a moving picture, one can see men making a clearing
along the east bank of the Mississippi River, one
hundred and ten miles from its mouth. It is 1718. The
French Canadian Bienville has been made governor of the
great tract of land called Louisiana, and he has decided
to found a settlement near the river's mouth.</p>

<p>At the end of three years the little French town, named
for the duke of Orleans, stands peacefully on the banks
of the great Mississippi, its people buying, selling, fighting
duels, and steadily thriving until the close of the
French and Indian War. Then France cedes Louisiana
to Spain, and for some years New Orleans is under
Spanish rule. In 1800, however, Spain cedes Louisiana
back to France, and once more New Orleans has a French
commissioner and is a French possession.</p>

<p>Again the scene changes. Energetic, sturdy men sail
down the river, land in the quaint little town, and march
to the Cabildo, or Government Hall, where they receive
the keys of the town. Because of the Louisiana Purchase,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
New Orleans with all its inhabitants&mdash;Spanish, French,
Italians, and Jews&mdash;is being given over to the United
States. The French flag is taken down, and the Stars and
Stripes are unfurled over what was, and is to-day, the
least American of all American cities.</p>

<p>As the history of New Orleans unrolls, one follows the
thrilling scenes of a great battle. It is in the War of
1812, and on the last
day of December, 1814,
the British begin an attack
on the city, with
an army of 10,000
trained soldiers. They
mean to capture New
Orleans and gain control
of Louisiana and the
mouth of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Andrew Jackson commands
the American
forces, made up of regulars,
militia, pirates,
negroes, and volunteers,
numbering only about
half the attacking British
army. Day after day goes by with no great victory gained
on either side, until Sunday, January 8, dawns. With the
daylight, the British commence a furious assault. But
Jackson and his men are ready for them. Rushing back
and forth along his line of defense, the commander cries
out, &ldquo;Stand by your guns!&rdquo; &ldquo;See that every shot tells!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Let's finish the business to-day!&rdquo; Many of Jackson's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
men are sharpshooters. Time and again they aim and fire,
and time and again the enemy advance, fall back, rally,
and try to advance once more. But in three short hours
the British leader and more than 2500 men have dropped,
hundreds shot between the eyes. It is no use! In confusion
the British turn and flee. Jackson has saved the city.</p>

</div>

<p>In the Civil War the turn of affairs is different. Louisiana
was one of the seven states to secede from the Union
in 1860 and form themselves into the Confederate States
of America. Of course this made New Orleans a Confederate
city. Naturally, the north wanted to capture
New Orleans in order to control the mouth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Mississippi River. This time the attacking force is a
Union fleet, and the defenders of the city are stanch
Confederates who have done all in their power to prevent
the approach of the Northerners. Across the river, near
its mouth, two great cables have been stretched, and between
the cables and the city are a Confederate fleet and
two forts, one on each side of the river.</p>

<p>The Union fleet under David Farragut appears, opens
fire on the forts, and keeps up the attack for six days
and nights. Still the forts hold out. Then Farragut decides
that since he cannot take the forts he will run
his ships past them. But there are the cables blocking his
way. The steamer <i>Itasca</i> undertakes to break them and
rushes upon them under a raking fire from both forts.
The cables snap. That night the Union ships, in single
file, start up the river. At last the forts are passed and
the Confederate ships overcome, but not the spirit of the
people of New Orleans. They fight to the finish as best
they can. Cotton bales are piled on rafts, set afire, and
floated downstream among the Union ships. Still the
ships come on. At least the Northerners shall not take
the valuable stores of cotton, sugar, and molasses! So
the cotton ships are fired, and hogsheads of molasses and
barrels of sugar are hurriedly destroyed. When the Union
forces land and takes possession, the people of New Orleans,
though heartbroken, know that they have done their best.</p>

<p>Then comes peace. The war is over, and New Orleans
is once more a city of the United States.</p>

<p>To-day New Orleans presents the unusual combination
of an old city, full of historic interest, and a splendid new
city, a place of industry, progress, and opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>The successful building of a great city on the site of
New Orleans is a triumph of engineering skill. As the
city lies below the high-water mark of the Mississippi, it
was necessary to build great banks of earth to hold back
the water in the flood season. These levees, as they are
called, form the water front of the city.</p>

<p>In the early days the only drinking-water in New
Orleans was rain water caught from the roofs and stored in
cisterns. Imagine a city without a single cellar. Then not
even a grave could be dug in the marshy soil. The cemeteries
were all aboveground. In some cemeteries there
were tiers of little vaults, one above the other, in which
the dead were laid. In others, magnificent tombs provided
resting places for the wealthy. Such was old New Orleans.
To-day modern sewers and huge steam pumps draw off
the sewage and excess water, discharging them into the
river, while a splendid water system filters water taken
from higher up the river, giving a supply as pure as that
enjoyed by any city in our land. The marshes have been
drained by the construction of canals, which are used as
highways for bringing raw materials from the surrounding
country to the factories of New Orleans. Many of these
canals extend for miles into the interior of the state
of Louisiana.</p>

<p class="caption">THE CITY OF NEW ORLEANS</p>
</div>

<p>The city proper covers nearly two hundred square miles
and is laid out in beautiful streets, parks, and driveways,
crossed in many places by picturesque waterways. Here
are splendid trees, belonging both to the temperate zone
and to the tropics. Palms and cypresses abound. In the
City Park is one of the finest groves of live oaks in the
world. Audubon Park, named for the great lover of birds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a><br /><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>

parks of New Orleans.</p>

<p class="caption">CANAL STREET</p>
</div>

<p>Canal Street divides New Orleans into two sections,
with the Old Town, or French Quarter, on one side and the
New Town, or American Quarter, on the other. This
is the main thoroughfare of the city. It is a wide street,
well-kept and busy. Here are many of the great retail
stores, and to this street comes every car line. From
Canal Street one may take a car to any section of the
city, and a car taken in any part of New Orleans will
sooner or later bring one to Canal Street. On this street
are handsome stores, club buildings, hotels, railroad stations,
and the United States customhouse. The upper
end of the street is a beautiful residence section, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
houses are surrounded by spacious lawns and fine trees.
Almost all of these houses have wide galleries, or verandas,
upon which their owners may sit and enjoy, all the year
round, the balmy air of the southern climate. Very seldom
does the temperature drop below 30 degrees Fahrenheit.
Usually it is between 50 and 60 degrees, and even
in summer it varies only between 75 and 90 degrees. New
Orleans is really cooler in summer than some of our
northern cities, being so surrounded by river and lakes.</p>

<p class="caption">A CREOLE COURTYARD</p>
</div>

<p>The old New Orleans lies northeast of Canal Street.
Here the early settlers established their homes, and in
this French Quarter the French language is still in common
use, and many old French customs are observed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
The streets, many of which bear French names, are narrow
and roughly paved and are closely built up with old-fashioned
brick buildings ornamented with iron verandas.
Open gateways in the front of many a gloomy-looking
house give us a glimpse of attractive interior courts, gay
with flowers and splashing fountains. Many other courts,
alas, are deserted or neglected, for this is no longer the
fashionable section of New Orleans. Most of the city's
creole population lives in the French Quarter. These
people are the descendants of the early French and
Spanish inhabitants.</p>

<p>In the French Quarter is Jackson Square, which was the
center of governmental life in the early years of the city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Here are the Cabildo&mdash;the old Spanish court building&mdash;and
the Cathedral of St. Louis, an old and beautiful church.
On Chartres Street is the Archiepiscopal Palace, said to
be the oldest public building in the Mississippi Valley.</p>

<p>The French Market is one of the world's famous market
places. In the long low buildings occupying four city
blocks may be found fruits, vegetables, meats, fish, and
game in wonderful variety. To the Oyster Lugger Landing
come the oyster boats, bringing from the bays of the
Gulf coast some of the finest oysters in America. Other
points of interest in the French Quarter are the Royal
Hotel, formerly known as the St. Louis Hotel; the
United States mint; the Soldiers' Home, whose gardens
are noted for their beauty; Bayou St. John, a picturesque
waterway; and Jackson Barracks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>Two other places must not be slighted. In the Ursuline
convent stands a statue before which, on January 8, 1815,
the nuns prayed for the success of the Americans in
the battle of New Orleans. Then there is St. Roch's
Shrine, a chapel built by Father Thevis. Each stone in it
was placed by his
own hands, in fulfillment
of a vow
that &ldquo;if none of his
parishioners should
die of an epidemic,
he would, stone by
stone, build a chapel
in thanksgiving to
God.&rdquo; This ancient
shrine is visited by
thousands of people
every year.</p>

<p>To the southwest
of Canal Street is
the American Quarter.
This was originally
a tract of land,
known as the Terre
Commune, reserved by the French government for public
use. But after a while the land was laid out in streets.
Soon the merchants of this section began to trade with
the North and West. The river boats landed in front of
the Faubourg St. Marie, as this part of the city was then
called, bringing tobacco, cotton, pork, beef, corn, flour,
and fabrics. Commercial buildings sprang up, and as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
trade was distinctly American, the district came to be
known as the American Quarter.</p>

<p>In the days when the French Quarter was all there was
of New Orleans, the city was in the shape of a half moon
or crescent. The newer part of the city follows the course
of the river and makes the New Orleans of to-day more
like a letter S.</p>

<p class="caption">ST. CHARLES AVENUE</p>
</div>

<p>St. Charles Avenue is the most beautiful residential
street in the American Quarter. It is a wide avenue with
driveways on either side of a grassy parkway. Rows of
trees, many of them stately palms, border the avenue.
Here are splendid homes, each with its flower beds and
gardens of tropical plants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Churches and charitable institutions abound in New
Orleans. One of the latter, Touro Infirmary, covers an
entire city block. This infirmary was endowed by Judah
Touro, a Jew, and is supported by Jews, but receives sufferers
of any creed. In its courtyard is a fountain erected
by the Hebrew children of New Orleans.</p>

<p>Tulane University is the most renowned educational
institution in the city, and is noted for its medical and
engineering departments. On Washington Avenue is the
H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College for young women,
which is the women's department of Tulane University.</p>

<p>The great hotels and many restaurants of the city are
noted throughout the United States. The creole cooks
have made famous such dishes as chicken gumbo, chicken
à la creole, and pompano.</p>

<p>The country around New Orleans is one of the richest
in the world. Within a few hours' ride of the city are
great fields of cotton, sugar, and rice. Two hundred miles
from the city are immense deposits of sulphur and salt.
Oil fields are within easy reach, and coal is brought by
water from the mines of Alabama and even from Pennsylvania.
Great forests to the north furnish lumber which
is transported by water to the city, making New Orleans
one of the foremost ports in lumber exportation.</p>

<p class="caption">A SUGAR-CANE FIELD</p>
</div>

<p>The immense sugar-cane fields of the South look very
much like the cornfields of the more northern states.
Negroes cut the cane close to the ground, as the lower part
of the stalk has the most sugar. After the leaves and
tops have been trimmed off, the stalks are shipped to the
presses, cut into small pieces, and crushed between heavy
rollers. The juice is strained, boiled, and worked over to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
remove the impurities, and then, in a brownish mass called
raw sugar, is sent to great refineries to be made by more
boiling and other processes into the white sugar we use
daily. This sugar industry is very important, as figures
show that each American, both grown-ups and children,
consumes an average of more than seventy pounds of
sugar a year.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">A SUGAR REFINERY</p>
</div>

<p>Away down South is the land of cotton as well as the
land of sugar, and there is no more beautiful sight than a
field white with the opening bolls of the cotton plant.
Between the long white rows pass the picturesque negroes
with their big baskets into which they put the soft fleecy
cotton as they pick it from the bolls. The raw cotton is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
then sent to the cotton
gin, where the
seeds are taken out
to be made into cottonseed
oil. The cotton
itself is shipped
to factories where it
is made into thread
and cotton cloth of
all kinds. In addition
to the immense
quantities sent to
the mills in various
parts of the United
States, New Orleans
ships to Europe each
year over $100,000,000
worth. When
the cotton reaches
the city it is in the
form of bales covered
with coarse cloth
and bound with iron
bands. The great
steamers waiting at
the dock must fill
their holds to the
best advantage in
order that they may
carry as large an
amount as possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
on each voyage. The cotton as it comes from the plantation
presses occupies too much space. It is interesting to
stand near the steamship landings and see the workmen
cast off the iron bands and place the bales between the
powerful jaws of huge presses which seem, almost without
effort, to close down upon the mass of fleecy whiteness and
cause it to shrink from four feet to about one foot in
thickness. While the cotton is still under pressure, iron
bands are once more placed upon it, and the bale is then
taken from the press. After this process four bales can be
loaded on the steamer in the space which one plantation
bale would have occupied.</p>

<p class="caption">A BANANA CONVEYOR</p>
</div>

<p>The location of New Orleans near the mouth of the
Mississippi and close enough to the Gulf of Mexico to be
called a Gulf port makes it naturally the great port of
exchange of all the products of the Mississippi Valley, the
islands of the Gulf, and the countries on the north coast
of South America. It is the second largest export port in
America and is the world's greatest export market for
cotton. Oysters and fish in abundance are brought to
the city from the Gulf, making New Orleans one of the
largest fish-and-oyster markets in the United States. More
bananas arrive at New Orleans than at any other port
in the world. The great bunches of fruit are unloaded
by machinery, placed upon specially designed cars, and
sent by the fastest trains to the various parts of the
United States. With the sugar-producing districts so
near, New Orleans is, of course, one of our country's chief
sugar markets. The largest sugar refinery in the world is
located here.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned the water front, but this
important and interesting part of the city deserves more
attention. For fifteen miles along the river, the port of this
great city stretches in an almost unbroken line of wharves
and steel sheds. The steamboat landings are near the foot
of Canal Street, and here may be seen the river packets
from Northern cities and the little stern-wheelers which
run up Red River. Above is the flatboat landing, and
further on still are the tropical-fruit wharves and miles of
wharves for foreign shipping.</p>

<p>Just below Canal Street are the sugar sheds, where
barrels and hogsheads of sugar and molasses cover blocks
and blocks. At Julia Street are huge coffee sheds where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
more than 80,000
bags of coffee, each
bag holding about
138 pounds, can be
stored in the large
steel warehouses.
At Louisiana Avenue
are the huge
Stuyvesant Docks,
which cover 2000
feet of river frontage.
One of the
big elevators here
will hold 1,500,000
bushels of grain,
another 1,000,000
bushels. Each one
can unload 250
cars a day and deliver
freight to 4
steamships at the
same time.</p>

play as of work.
Their love of music

fine opera house, where celebrated French operas are given.
Because of its gayety, which attracts many visitors, especially
in winter, New Orleans has been called the Winter
Capital of America.</p>

<p>The city's great holiday is the Mardi Gras carnival,
which is celebrated just before Lent. The keys of the city
are then given over to the King of the Carnival, and all
day long high revelry holds sway. Brilliant floats, representing
scenes of wonderful quaintness and loveliness,
parade through flower-garlanded avenues thronged with
people who have come from every quarter of the globe.
Carried away by the spirit of the fête, these guests join
with the citizens in turning New Orleans for the time into
a fairy city of wonder and delight.</p>

<h2><a name="WASHINGTON" id="WASHINGTON">WASHINGTON</a></h2>

<p class="title"><span style="font-size: 125%;">THE CAPITAL CITY</span></p>

<p>Washington, the capital city of our nation, is the
center of interest for the whole country. Every citizen
of the United States thinks of the city of Washington
as a place in which he has a personal pride.</p>

<p>Here one may see in operation the work of governing
a great nation. The representatives whom the people
have chosen meet in the splendid Capitol to make laws
for the whole country. The home of the president is
here, and here are located the headquarters of the great
departments of our government.</p>

<p>The capital city is a city of splendid trees, of wide,
well-paved streets and handsome avenues. At the intersection
of many of the streets and avenues are beautiful
parks and circles, ornamented by statues of the great
men of the nation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How,&rdquo; we are asked, &ldquo;did it happen that the capital
of a great nation was built almost on its eastern boundary?&rdquo;
The distance from Washington to San Francisco
is 3205 miles. In other words, Washington is almost as
near to London as to San Francisco. The answer is simple.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
The site was chosen when the settled part of our country
lay between the Allegheny Mountains and the Atlantic
Ocean. At that time most of the land west of the
Alleghenies was looked upon as a wilderness whose
settlement was uncertain, while no one dreamed that
the infant nation would extend its boundaries to the
Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why was it decided to build a new city as the
nation's capital, on a site where there was not even a
settlement? Why was not some city already established
chosen to be the chief city of the nation?&rdquo; The story
is interesting.</p>

<p>Before the Revolutionary War the colonies were much
like thirteen independent nations, having little to do with
one another, but during the war a common peril held
them together in a loose union. With the danger passed
and independence won, this union threatened to dissolve,
but thanks to the influence of the wisest and best men
in the country the thirteen states finally became one
nation and adopted the Constitution which governs the
United States to-day. Then discussion arose as to the
site of the new nation's capital. Several states clamored
for the honor of having one of their cities chosen as the
government city. The men who framed the Constitution
were wise enough, however, to foresee difficulty if this
were done, and insisted that the seat of government
should be in no state but in a small territory which
should be controlled entirely by the national government.</p>

<p>After much debate the present location was chosen,
and the two states of Maryland and Virginia each gave
to the federal government entire control over a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
territory on the Potomac River. The two pieces of land
formed a square, ten miles on each side. The territory was
named the District of Columbia, and the city to be built
was called Washington in honor of our first president,
whose home, Mount Vernon, was but a few miles away.
Later, in 1846, the Virginia part of the District was given
back, so now all the District is on the Maryland side of
the Potomac and is no longer in the shape of a square.</p>

</div>

<p>A firm belief in the future of Washington led to the
making of very elaborate and extensive plans for laying
out the city. But as the public buildings began to rise,
with great stretches of unimproved country between them,
many thought the plans much too elaborate and feared
that the attempt to build a new city would end in failure.
It was in the fall of 1800 when the government moved
to Washington. Then, in 1814, when things had taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
a start, a dreadful misfortune happened; just a few
months before the close of the war of 1812, the British
attacked the city and burned both the Capitol and the
White House. In spite of these early discouragements
and years of ridicule, the capital has fully justified the
plans and hopes of the far-seeing men who built not
for their own day but
for the years to come.</p>

<p>Perhaps one gets the
best idea of the city to-day
from the height of
the Capitol's beautiful
dome that rises over
three hundred feet above
the pavement. There is
a gallery around the outside
of the dome, just
below the lantern which
lights its summit, and
from here one can see
for miles in any direction.</p>

<p>Our view of the city from this height shows us that
most of the streets are straight and run either north and
south or east and west. The east and west streets are lettered;
those running north and south are numbered. One
might easily imagine four great checkerboards placed
together, with the Capitol standing at the point where the
four boards meet. I say four checkerboards, because from
the Capitol three great streets go to the north, the south,
and the east, while a broad park runs away to the west,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
thus dividing the city into four sections. Running across
the regularly planned streets of these checkerboards are
broad avenues, many of which seem to come like spokes
of wheels from parks placed in different sections of the
city. These avenues are named for different states.</p>

<p>Close about us is a splendid group of majestic buildings.
The Capitol, upon the brow of the hill overlooking
the western part of the city, is the center of the group.
To the north and south of the Capitol rise the beautiful
marble buildings for the use of the committees of the
Senate and the House of Representatives. To the east is
the Library of Congress, the most beautiful building of its
kind in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Toward the northwest and southeast runs Pennsylvania
Avenue, one hundred sixty feet wide, the most famous
street in the city. About a mile and a half up Pennsylvania
Avenue from the Capitol is another imposing group
of public buildings. Here are the Treasury Department,
the Executive Mansion,&mdash;the home of the president,&mdash;and
the State, War, and Navy Building. Pennsylvania
Avenue leads past the fronts of these buildings and on for
more than two miles to the far-western part of the city.</p>

<p class="caption">A VIEW OF PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE</p>
</div>

<p>Directly west from the Capitol we look along the fine
parkways which divide the city in that direction just as
do the main streets which run from the Capitol to the
north, east, and south. This handsome series of parks is
called the Mall. In the Mall are a number of public
buildings placed in an irregular line stretching west
from the Capitol, with sufficient distance between them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
to allow spacious grounds for each building. Here we
find the home of the Bureau of Fisheries, the Army
Medical Museum, the National Museum, the Smithsonian
Institution, the Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of
Engraving and Printing, and the Washington Monument.</p>

<p>As we walk around the gallery of the Capitol dome,
we see that almost every street and avenue is lined on
either side with beautiful shade trees which give the city
a gardenlike appearance. And looking toward the south
we see the eastern branch of the Potomac meeting the
main stream and flowing away in a majestic river, over a
mile in width. On all sides of the city the land rises
in beautiful green hills, guarding the nation's capital as it
lies nestled between the river's protecting arms.</p>

<p>Having this picture of the general plan of Washington,
let us visit some of the buildings; first of all the Capitol,
for it is the most imposing as well as the most important
building in the city. For a good view of the building,
walk out upon the spacious esplanade which extends
across the eastern front. Even here it is hard to appreciate
that the Capitol is over 751 feet long, 350 feet wide,
and covers more than 3&frac12; acres of ground. The eastern
front shows the building to have three divisions, a central
building and a northern and a southern wing. Each division
has a splendid portico with stately Corinthian columns
and a broad flight of steps leading to the portico from
the eastern esplanade.</p>

<p class="caption">THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL</p>
</div>

<p>Every four years a new president of the United States
is elected, and March 4 is the day on which he takes
office. On this day a great stand is put up over the steps
leading to the central portico of the Capitol, and upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a><br /><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
this platform a most imposing ceremony takes place. Here
the new president, in the presence of all the members of
Congress, the representatives of foreign nations, many distinguished
guests, and an immense throng of people, takes
upon himself the obligations of his high office. The Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court holds a Bible before the
president, who places his hand upon it and repeats these
words: &ldquo;I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute
the office of President of the United States, and will,
to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the
Constitution of the United States.&rdquo; After the president
has delivered his inaugural address, a splendid procession
escorts him to his new home, the Executive Mansion.</p>

<p class="caption">WHEN PRESIDENT WILSON WAS INAUGURATED</p>
</div>

<p>Above the central division of the Capitol building,
which for many years served as the entire Capitol, rises
the imposing dome from which we have just come. It is
crowned with a lantern upon the top of which is placed
the statue of Freedom.</p>

<p>Across the western front of the Capitol is a marble
terrace overlooking the lower part of the city. Though
the western front is ornamented with colonnades of Corinthian
columns, it lacks the splendid approaches of the
eastern side.</p>

<p>This immense building, representing the dignity and
greatness of our nation, is given over almost entirely to
the work of lawmaking. In the central part is the large
rotunda beneath the lofty dome. The northern wing is
occupied by the Senate of the United States, while the
southern wing is the home of the House of Representatives.
We enter the rotunda by the broad stairs leading
from the eastern esplanade and find ourselves in a great
circular hall, almost a hundred feet in diameter, whose
walls curve upward one hundred and eighty feet. At the
top a beautiful canopy shows the Father of his Country
in the company of figures representing the thirteen original
states. About these are other figures, personifying
commerce, freedom, mechanics, agriculture, dominion over
the sea, and the arts and sciences. Encircling the upper
part of the walls, but many feet below the canopy, is a
frieze of scenes from the history of the United States.</p>

<p>Around the lower part of the walls are eight great
paintings. Four of them are the work of one of Washington's
officers, Colonel John Trumbull of Connecticut,
and are of great interest because the figures are actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
portraits of the people represented. These paintings show
the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the
surrender of Burgoyne at Saratoga, the surrender of
Cornwallis at Yorktown, and the resignation of General
Washington at the close of the Revolution.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">STATUARY HALL, IN THE CAPITOL</p>
</div>

<p>From the rotunda, broad corridors lead north to the
Senate Chamber and south to the House of Representatives.
Following the corridor to the south, we come to
a large semicircular room. When the central division of
the building was all there was to the Capitol, this room
was occupied by the House of Representatives, and here
were heard the speeches of Adams, Webster, Clay, Calhoun,
and many other famous statesmen. It is now set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
apart as a national statuary hall, where each state may
place two statues of her chosen sons. As many of the
states have been glad to honor their great men in this
way, a splendid array of national heroes is gathered in
the hall. Among the Revolutionary heroes we find Washington,
Ethan Allen, and Nathaniel Green. A statue of
Fulton, sent by New York, shows him seated, looking at a
model of his steamship. Of all these marble figures, perhaps
none attracts more attention than that of Frances
Elizabeth Willard, the great apostle of temperance, and
to the state of Illinois belongs the distinction of having
placed the only statue of a woman in this great collection.</p>

<p>Leaving Statuary Hall, we go south to the Hall of
Representatives. Here representatives from all the states
gather to frame laws for the entire nation. Seated in
the gallery it seems almost as if we were in a huge
schoolroom, for the representatives occupy seats which
are arranged in semicircles, facing a white marble desk
upon a high platform reached by marble steps. This is
the desk of the Speaker of the House. The Speaker's
duty is to preserve order and to see that the business of
this branch of Congress is carried on as it should be.
Before delivering a speech, a representative must have
the Speaker's permission. The Speaker is a most important
person, for all business is transacted under his direction.
The representatives come from every state in the
Union, and even far-off Hawaii, Alaska, and the Philippines
are allowed to send delegates to this assembly to
represent them in making laws. Think what a serious
matter it would have been to the people of the far West
to have the capital of their nation in the extreme Eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
section of the country if the development of the railroads,
the telegraph, and the telephone had not made travel
and communication so easy that great distances are no
longer obstacles.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">THE OPENING OF CONGRESS</p>
</div>

<p>But we can pay only a brief visit to the House of
Representatives, for there is another body of lawmakers
in the northern end of the Capitol which we wish to see.
Back to the rotunda we go and then walk along a corridor
leading to the northern, or Senate, end of the Capitol.
Each day, for a number of months in the year, an interesting
ceremony takes place in this corridor promptly
at noon. Nine dignified men, clad in long black silk
robes, march in solemn procession across the corridor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
and enter a stately chamber which, though smaller, resembles
Statuary Hall in shape. These men make up
the Supreme Court of the United States, the highest
court of justice in the land.</p>

<p>Often in cases at law a person does not feel that the
decision of one court has been just. He may then have
his case examined and passed upon by a higher court.
This is called &ldquo;appealing,&rdquo; and some cases, for good
cause, may be appealed from one court to another until
they reach the Supreme Court. Beyond the Supreme
Court there is no appeal. What this court decides must
be accepted as final. The room in which the Supreme
Court meets was once used as the Senate Chamber, and
many of the great debates heard in the Senate before our
Civil War were held in this room.</p>

<p>The Senate Chamber of to-day is further down the
north corridor. This room is not unlike the Hall of
Representatives in plan and arrangement, though it is
somewhat smaller. Instead of having a chairman of their
own choosing, as is the case in the House, the Senate
is presided over by the vice president of the United
States. This high official, seated upon a raised platform,
directs the proceedings of the Senate just as the Speaker
directs those of the House of Representatives. There
seems to be an air of greater solemnity and dignity in
this small group of lawmakers than in the House of Representatives.
It is smaller because each state is entitled to
send but two senators to the Senate, whereas the number
of representatives is governed by the number of inhabitants
in the state. The populous state of New York has
thirty-seven representatives and but two senators, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
same number as the little state of Rhode Island whose
population entitles it to only two representatives.</p>

<p>The purpose of having two lawmaking bodies is to provide
a safeguard against hasty and unwise legislation. In
the House of Representatives the most populous states
have the greatest influence, while in the Senate all states
are equally represented, and each state has two votes
regardless of its size and population. Since every proposed
law must be agreed to in both the Senate and the
House before it is taken to the president for his approval,
each body acts as a check on the other in lawmaking.</p>

<p class="caption">INAUGURAL PARADE ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE</p>
</div>

<p>Just to the east of the Capitol grounds stands the
magnificent Library of Congress. This wonderful storehouse
of books is a marvelous palace. It covers almost
an entire city block, and its towering gilded dome is visible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
from almost every part of the city. Once inside, we could
easily believe ourselves in fairyland, so beautiful are the
halls and the staircases of carved marble, so wonderful the
paintings and the decorations. Every available space upon
the walls and ceilings is adorned with pictures, with the
names of the great men of the world, and with beautiful
quotations from the poets and scholars who seem to live
again in this magnificent building which is dedicated to
the things they loved.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

        alt="see caption"
        title="see caption" />
<p class="caption">BOTANICAL GARDENS</p>
</div>

<p>In the center of the building, just beneath the gilded
dome, is a rotunda slightly wider than the rotunda of the
Capitol, though not so high. Here are desks for the use
of those who wish to consult any volume of the immense
collection of books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>The books are kept in great structures called stacks,
9 stories high and containing bookshelves which would
stretch nearly 44 miles if placed in one line. Any one
of the great collection of 1,300,000 volumes can be sent
by machinery from the stacks to the reading room or to
the Capitol. When a member of Congress wants a book
which is in the Library, he need not leave the Capitol,
for there is a tunnel connecting the two buildings through
which runs a little car to carry books.</p>

<p>The Librarian of Congress has charge of the enforcement
of the copyright law. By means of this law an
author may secure the exclusive right to publish a book,
paper, or picture for twenty-eight years. One of the requirements
of the copyright law is that the author must
place in the Library of Congress two copies of whatever
he has copyrighted. Hence, on the shelves of this great
library may be found almost every book or paper published
in the United States.</p>

<p>Leaving the Library we once more find ourselves upon
the great esplanade east of the Capitol. In the majestic
white-marble buildings to the north and south,&mdash;known
as the Senate and House office buildings,&mdash;committees
of each House of Congress meet to discuss proposed laws.</p>

<p>Having seen the lawmakers at work in the Capitol,
let us visit the officials whose duty it is to enforce the
laws made by Congress.</p>

<p>Chief among these is the president of the United States.
His house is officially known as the Executive Mansion,
but nearly everybody speaks of it as the White House.
The first public building erected in Washington was the
White House. It is said that Washington himself chose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
the site. He lived to see it built but not occupied, for
the capital was not moved to the District of Columbia
until 1800, a year after Washington's death.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

        alt="see caption"
        title="see caption" />
<p class="caption">THE WHITE HOUSE FROM THE NORTH</p>
</div>

<p>This simple, stately building is a fitting home for the
head of a great republic. In the main building are the
living apartments of the president and his family, and
the great rooms used for state receptions; the largest
and handsomest of these is the famous East Room. Other
rooms used on public occasions are known, from the color
of the furnishings and hangings, as the Blue Room, the
Green Room, and the Red Room. There is also the great
State Dining Room, where the president entertains at
dinner the important government officials and foreign
representatives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Annex, adjoining the White House on the west,
are the offices of the president and those who assist him
in his work. In this part of the building is the cabinet
room, where the president meets the heads of the various
departments to consult with them concerning questions
of national importance.</p>

<p>Across the street from the president's office is the immense
granite building occupied by the three departments
of State, War, and Navy. The secretaries in charge of
these departments have their offices here, together with
a small army of clerks.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

        alt="see caption"
        title="see caption" />
<p class="caption">THE UNITED STATES TREASURY</p>
</div>

<p>On the opposite side of the White House from the
State, War, and Navy Building is the National Treasury.
The Treasury Building is one of the finest in the city.
To see the splendid colonnade on the east is alone worth a
journey to Washington. From this building all the money
affairs of the United States government are directed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Treasury Building and in the Bureau of Engraving
and Printing one may see the entire process of manufacturing
and issuing paper money. In the Treasury we
see new bills exchanged for old, worn-out bills, which are
ground to pieces to destroy forever their value as money.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/img_285.jpg" width="600" height="465"
        alt="see caption"
        title="see caption" />
<p class="caption">BUREAU OF ENGRAVING AND PRINTING, &ldquo;UNCLE SAM'S MONEY FACTORY&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>But to understand the story of a dollar bill or a bill
of any other value we must visit the Bureau of Engraving
and Printing. This building, which is some distance from
the Treasury Building, reminds us of a large printing
office, and that is just what it is. Here we are shown
from room to room where many men and women are at
work, some engraving the plates from which bills are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
be printed and others printing the bills. The paper used
is manufactured by a secret process for United States
money, and every sheet is most carefully counted at
every stage of the printing. Altogether the sheets are
counted fifty-two times. Many clerks are employed to
keep a careful account of these sheets, and it is almost
impossible for a single bill or a single piece of paper to
be lost or stolen. After the money is printed it is put
into bundles, sealed, and sent in a closely guarded steel
wagon to the Treasury Building, where it is stored in
great vaults until it is issued.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/img_286.jpg" width="600" height="374"
        alt="see caption"
        title="see caption" />
<p class="caption">A CIRCLE AND ITS RADIATING AVENUES</p>
</div>

<p>At the Treasury we find the officials sending out these
crisp new bills in payment of the debts of the United
States or in exchange for bills which are so tattered and
torn that they are no longer useful. This exchanging of
new money for old is a large part of the business of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Treasury and calls for the greatest care in counting and
keeping records, in order that no mistakes may be made.</p>

<p>After the old bills are counted they are cut in half
and the halves counted separately, to make sure that
the first count was correct. When the exact amount of
money has been determined, new bills are sent out to the
owners of the old bills, and the old bills are destroyed.</p>

<p>When we have seen enough of the counting of old
money, our guide takes us down into the cellar of this
great building, where we walk along a narrow passageway
with millions of dollars in gold and silver on either
hand. All is carefully secured by massive doors and
locks, and none but trusted officials may enter the vaults
themselves. These gold and silver coins are made in the
United States mints in Philadelphia, Denver, New Orleans,
and San Francisco.</p>

<p>You see the paper bill is not real money but a sort
of receipt representing gold and silver money which you
can get at any time from the Treasury. As we peep
through the barred doors of the vaults and see great
piles of canvas sacks, it is interesting to know that some
of the silver and gold coins they hold are ours, waiting
here while we carry in our pockets the paper bills which
represent them.</p>

<p>In addition to issuing money, the Treasury Department
has charge of collecting all the taxes and duties which
furnish the money for the payment of the expenses of
the government.</p>

<p>Washington is a government city. Of its population
of over 330,000, about 36,000 are directly engaged in the
various departments of the government, while most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
other lines of business thrive by supplying the needs of
the government's employees and their families. Very little
manufacturing is done in the District of Columbia, and
such articles as are manufactured are chiefly for local use.</p>

<p>People from almost every country in the world may
be seen on the streets, for almost all civilized nations
have ministers or ambassadors at Washington to represent
them in official dealings with the United States. These
foreign representatives occupy fine homes, and during the
winter season many brilliant receptions are given by them
as well as by our own high officials.</p>

<p>The people of Washington have built fine churches and
many handsome schools, to which all, from the president
to the humblest citizen, send their children. In or near
the city are the five universities of George Washington,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Georgetown, Howard University for colored people, the
Catholic University, and the American University, where
graduates from other colleges take advanced work.</p>

<p>The citizens of the District of Columbia do not vote
nor do they make their own laws, as it was feared there
might be a disagreement between Congress and the city
government if people voted on local matters. All laws
for the District of Columbia are made by the Congress
of the United States and are carried out by three
commissioners appointed by the president with the consent
of the Senate. Many inhabitants of the District are
citizens of the states and go to their homes at election
time to cast their votes. Isn't it strange that there is a
place in the United States where the citizens cannot vote?</p>

<p>You are, no doubt,
beginning to think that
the places of interest in
Washington must be very
numerous. This is true,
for few cities in the world
have so many interesting
public buildings. Among
these are the Corcoran
Art Gallery; the Continental
Memorial Hall,
the majestic marble building
of the Daughters of
the American Revolution;
and the palatial home of
the Pan-American Union,
a place where representatives
of all the American
republics may meet.
Then there is the Patent
Office, for recording and
filing old patents and
granting new ones; the
Pension Office, from
which our war veterans
receive a certain sum each
year; the Government
Printing Office, whose reports
require over a million
dollars' worth of paper
each year; Ford's Theater,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
where President Lincoln was shot; the naval-gun factory,
for making the fourteen-inch long-range guns used on our
battleships; and the Union Railroad Station, whose east wing
is reserved for the
use of the president.</p>

<p class="caption">WASHINGTON MONUMENT FROM<br />
CONTINENTAL MEMORIAL HALL</p>
</div>

<p>There is one almost
sacred spot,
upon which the nation
has erected a
splendid memorial
to our greatest hero,
George Washington.
The Washington
Monument is a simple
obelisk of white
marble, that towers
555 feet above the
beautiful park in
the midst of which
it stands. Those
openings near the
top which seem so
small are 504 feet
above us and are
actually large windows.
On entering the door at the base of the monument,
we pass through the wall, which is 15 feet thick, and find
an elevator ready to carry us to the top. If we prefer to
walk, there is an interior stairway of 900 steps leading to
the top landing. At the end of our upward journey we
find ourselves in a large room with two great windows on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
each of the four sides. From here we get another view of
the hill-surrounded city, and the scene which lies before
us is inspiring.</p>

<p>The Washington Monument is near the western end of
the Mall, that series of parks extending from the Capitol
to the Potomac River. Near by are the buildings of the
Department of Agriculture, which has been of the greatest
help to the farmers of our land by sending out important
information concerning almost everything connected
with farm life. Through the Bureau of Chemistry this
department did much to bring about the passage of the
Pure Food Law, which protects the people by forbidding
the sale of food and drugs that are not pure.</p>

<p>In the spacious park adjoining the grounds of the
Department of Agriculture is a building which looks like
an ancient castle. This is the Smithsonian Institution,
which carries on scientific work under government control.</p>

<p>The National Museum, which is under the control of
the Smithsonian Institution, has a fine building of its own.
This museum is a perfect treasure house of interesting
exhibits of all kinds. Here may be seen relics of Washington,
of General Grant, and of other famous Americans;
and here are exhibits showing the history of the telegraph,
the telephone, the sewing machine, the automobile, and
the flying machine. Stuffed animals of all kinds are arranged
to look just as if they were alive. So numerous are
the exhibits that it would require a large book simply to
mention them. Many of the boys and girls of Washington
spend their Saturday afternoons examining the wonderful
things which have been brought to this museum from all
parts of the world.</p>

<p>Washington has also a zoölogical park where there
are animals from everywhere. It is on the banks of a
beautiful stream on the outskirts of the city and is part
of a great public park which covers many acres of picturesque
wooded country.</p>

<p>We must not omit the Post Office Department, for that
is the part of the federal government which comes nearest
to our homes. Here are the offices of the postmaster general
and his many assistants. To tell of the wonders of
our postal system would be a long story in itself. If all
the people employed by the Post Office Department lived
in Washington, they would fill all of the houses and leave
no room for anyone else. Of course this great army of
employees are not all in any one city, for the work of the
post office extends to every part of the United States, and,
through arrangement with other nations, to every part of
the civilized world.</p>

<p>In the country surrounding the city of Washington are
several important and interesting places. Just across the
river, in the state of Virginia, are Fort Myer, an army post,
and the famous Arlington National Cemetery. Arlington
was the home of Martha Custis, who became the bride of
George Washington. At the opening of the Civil War it
was the home of the famous Confederate general, Robert
E. Lee. Then it passed into the hands of the United States
government and is now the burial place of over sixteen
thousand soldiers who gave their lives for their country.</p>

<p>On the Virginia shore of the Potomac River, sixteen
miles south of the city of Washington, is Mount Vernon,
the home and burial place of George Washington. The
spacious old mansion in the midst of fine trees and shady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
lawns looks out over the wide peaceful river which Washington
loved. To this home Washington came to live
shortly after his marriage. He spent his time in farming
on this estate until he was called to take command of the
American army. After our independence was won he
returned to his home and his farm. Once more he was
called upon to leave this quiet country life to become the
first president of the new nation. When he had served his
country two terms he gladly retired to Mount Vernon,
where he lived until his death in 1799.</p>

<p class="caption">WASHINGTON'S TOMB</p>
</div>

<p>To-day the house and grounds are preserved with loving
care. The rooms of the house are furnished with fine
old mahogany furniture, many pieces of which belonged
to Washington. In the grounds, not far from the stately
mansion, is the simple brick tomb where rest the bodies
of Washington and his wife. During the years which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
have passed since his death, thousands of his countrymen
have come to this tomb to do honor to his memory.</p>

<p>As we sail up the Potomac toward the city after our
visit to the home of the great man whose name it bears,
the Washington Monument, the White House, the State,
War, and Navy Building, the Capitol, the Library, and
the post office tower above the surrounding buildings
and, shining in the golden light of sunset, make a picture
never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>This city of parks, of broad avenues, of beautiful buildings,
belongs to the Americans who live in the far-distant
states as well as to those who live and work in the capital
itself. It is our capital and we may justly be proud of it,
for it is one of the most beautiful cities in all the world.</p>
